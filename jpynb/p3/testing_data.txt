The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia.


It cannot be adopted for two reasons: firstly, the schemes are mutually exclusive, as in one scheme the seeds, in principle, have to be harvested as animal feed, while, in the other, they are designated for sowing. The other reason is that it might involve extra expense.



Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.


I can well understand why people there have points of view as to how it might perhaps be possible to make savings.
Personally, I find some of the decisions adopted extremely excessive, if not rash, such as, for example, the proposal to open the Community to Turkey - a country which I respect and which it is right to respect, despite its differences from the European Community in terms of history, culture and politics and the concept of the State as well, quite apart from the issue of human rights - and these decisions are evidence of an organisation which is becoming increasingly more economic than political.

Mr President, I welcomed the Minister's reply but I would like him to give an assurance to this House that he and the Council will not lose sight in their consideration of this problem of the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and that they will keep pressing the Iraqi authorities for an explanation of the fate of these people.

I have therefore written to all the Ministers for Transport of the fifteen countries of the Union to instigate a discussion on the subject, and also to ask for a report on what the situation is in their countries regarding this type of case, and what positive suggestions they can submit so that we can find a solution to this problem, which concerns us greatly, and which could have negative consequences for road safety, which has to be our main concern, and for fair competition, which is also important to us at the Commission.
Lastly, we should repeat that, as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes, with which - as I have said - the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle, we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals, which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population, thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and, therefore, its commitment to peace, since, without development, peace will always be difficult to attain.

There is now a new Commission.
The report now gives us the opportunity to develop a new basis on which to evaluate the work of the High Level Working Group and my group therefore supports the rapporteur.

Mr President, I can be brief about the championship itself: France is a fine European champion and the fear that the situation was going to get out of hand on a massive scale has at any rate been exaggerated despite a number of very regrettable incidents referred to by Mr Van Hecke, involving mainly English supporters

I should like to point out that in the morning the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, gave the impression, by appearing here in person and from what he said in his speech, that under the French presidency there would be closer, more systematic cooperation between the European Parliament and the presidency; however, in the afternoon, the first minister of the presidency to appear and work with us, the former MEP Mr Moscovici, did exactly the opposite.

Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.
British farmers particularly recognise that clear labelling is the best way of reassuring worried consumers that the beef they buy is safe.


We need to realise that a hard-line approach is sometimes required vis-à-vis the drugs mafia.

Because I do not speak Portuguese I shall study the reply before the next question time and come back to you on it in April.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is talk in this Chamber of who the winners in this conciliation are.




The situation remains extremely alarming in Afghanistan, where, since the Taliban have taken over power, women are no longer allowed to go out to work, are beaten in public for wearing indecent clothing and have hardly any access to medical care.
As we all know, there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers, Community banana producers, EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions, the EU's role and standing in the WTO and, of course, the rights and interests of European banana consumers.

Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude and congratulations for the work carried out both by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and by those who have worked on it in the Council and the Commission.

I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.

We in the European People' s Party see the family as a value per se, as the cornerstone of society, if you like, as the heart of society, and cannot accept that alternative life styles should be specially fostered and set above the family, which we see as the nucleus of our society.

But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.

We are of the opinion, therefore, that in order to accommodate this development within industry and sectors of industry, the advice of the working party must be followed at a high level and a coordinating centre set up to observe these changes.

Europe as a Community of values.
We must not only create agreements on the readmission clauses, and not only provide resources for guarding borders. We must also, by means of imagination and new measures, create the capacity for co-partnership with these countries, so that we can adopt a legal approach to the issue of immigration and so that people do not simply feel that we have closed the border to them but that they can move freely within this free trade area.

I fully agree with Mr Varela when he describes globalisation as a phenomenon whose repercussions vary according to specific cases.

Such a policy must also be combined with a means of obtaining details of the food situation and the health system in North Korea and must enable us to incorporate appropriate measures of aid into a political strategy so as to bring about an improvement in the general situation and perhaps also to initiate the development on which the long-term peace of the region depends, for the peace of that region, of course, is of global importance too.

We should be legally entitled to obtain documents when they are no longer within the confines of the Commission.

In the countries of the Southern Mediterranean, and specifically in the region of Murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment.



The Dutch use Belize and St Vincent and 4 vessels, of course, from my own country are flagged in Belize as well.

I am responsible for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' opinion on this matter, and our conclusions are simple and succinct.


Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.


This is also the thrust of the resolution and I would like a sound response from the European Commission.

My colleagues' register of interests is complete.


Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa, so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage, just prior to the elections, exactly as he has done in previous elections.


First, I should like to endorse in the most glowing terms possible the encomium that he delivered to my colleague, Commissioner Lamy, for the way he conducted these negotiations.

The framework programme will not suffice, it will have to be boosted, and its broad guidelines modified.




He also mentioned the state of the world today in terms which, I must admit, moved me and which I endorse.
I am confident that in Lisbon we will be able to take a step forwards, pooling benchmarking experiments and proposals on this major issue.

At present, the Commission is in the process of finalising discussions with its Member States, the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank about the main principles of the actual implementation of the Community support for the HIPC II Initiative, both as a donor and as a creditor.

This report can be used as a basis for further action.
The judge has ruled, in a devastating judgement, that he was "an active Holocaust denier, anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism" .
That is another aspect that shows that this Charter, if it really was adopted in the form called for by the European Parliament - but which we will oppose absolutely - would have the effect of a mechanism for reducing the powers of the nations.
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3.
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, literature has a few well-known words for what we are discussing in the two Savary reports this evening: "You are late, but at least you are here" , was how Friedrich Schiller put it, words which also apply to our work here in the European Parliament.

Tax harmonisation at European level should only take place in exceptional cases, for example in the cases of certain environmental taxes and taxes on capital.

I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.



Mr President, I would thank the rapporteur for a report that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party can fully support.

It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done.




We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.


I would like to stress once again that we have always said that this is about 'therapeutic cloning' .


A more stable neighbourhood and a more stable world guarantee a more stable European Union.


Indeed, I regret to say that the governments have not implemented the proposals adopted at Barcelona: democracy, the rule of law, transparency, social rights and an internal policy to prevent communities being forced to leave their countries.

The spread of the disease has exceeded every worst-case scenario, especially in Africa; as has already been mentioned, five people a minute die from Aids, which has now reached the point at which it is a threat to public health.
The Council awaits Parliament' s opinion with interest.
Our position has been to advocate an advisory rather than management procedure for the management of the regulation in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states: "The management procedure should be followed as regards management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural and common fisheries policies; also the implementation of programmes with substantial budgetary implications".
By the way, an irritating error has crept in to the erratum, where the experience of the pilot is referred to.
Would the Council be in favour of the adoption of measures whereby such situations afflicting women might be considered grounds for granting asylum and refuge, in political terms, in the European Union?



But what a contradiction. What a tragedy.


In this connection, I would just mention, for example, the right of entry, the right of establishment, the opportunity to enter the labour market, the coordination of social security systems, the right of establishment for non-gainfully employed people and students, together with new opportunities for cross-border workers.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to talk about noise generated by car tyres.

wow. I'm getting a fast torrent too!
Fortunately two or three Members (and the Commission as well) did read them.
This does not make it possible to conduct a redevelopment policy which takes account of the diagnosis of needs and the assessment of achievements, ultimately enabling the active administration of regional development.
We pensioners need to receive some of them!"
As the President has also been able to transfer funds for this purpose, altogether at this stage we can use around EUR 58 million for accelerated payments, which will lessen annual payments over the ten-year period by around EUR 8 to 9 million for Parliament, which is a great relief.
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.
There seems to be a problem with this generally, perhaps due to a lack of staff, and the Commission must ensure that it takes the measures needed to ensure that the implementation of European policies continues to be monitored.
This could have been brought out more clearly in the report.


Yet out of despair comes resolution, determination and hope.



But although we agree with the thrust of the Commission' s plan, my group would probably have reached different conclusions regarding the size and distribution of the proposed reductions under the external policy heading.
Where the general budget is concerned, I just want to highlight two serious issues, the Fléchard case and the problems surrounding ECHO's humanitarian aid, and also to emphasise that the whole budgeting process is characterised by a lack of precision.

I need to




I wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today's agenda, namely, the debate previewed for the late payments directive - the report of the conciliation procedure with the Council.
One of these concerns political priorities and the other concerns the coherence of our actions.


Mr President, what has not been stressed sufficiently thus far in the debate I believe is democracy and subsidiarity.
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.
This is all unattainable without peace and peace-building; conflict prevention, management and resolution must be top of the African agenda.
The original producer plays an important role in this, but is often bowing to the pressures of free market forces.
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.


In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.
We ought to bear this in mind, something I am convinced the Commission has done.




We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union.


It could increase bureaucracy from the point of view of the consumer.
With regard to the tabling of the so-called Antiterrorist Agreement in Spain, the presidency of this Parliament stated that this was signed by various associations and unions, and the Church was mentioned.
In other words: a person' s virtue makes democracy possible; on the other hand, his vices make it necessary.





Whenever we try it in the United Kingdom, any support from the government tends to mean that the film is going to be a flop.



Those seemed to be the undertones for a fleeting moment.
That is certainly the position the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously adopted.
Our basic concern relates to the possible effectiveness of the actions planned for countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia or Iraq, where political instability is combined with constant violations of the most basic human rights.
Legislation must be harmonised because people should no longer be able to play on the present differences in laws on asylum and on punishment between countries and consequently play the free movement card to try to evade European vigilance. We also need closer cooperation because we are dealing here with powerful organisations, which must be confronted.
Mr President, I should like to return to the subject of the annual legislative programme, after that digression on the European budget.
By relying on two pillars, the ECB strategy explicitly acknowledges uncertainty regarding the structure of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy within the economy.


icons look great

It should also have an encouraging effect, as a flexible part is left open for people who operate on an environmentally-friendly basis, provided that the Commission keeps a close eye on this whole process and checks whether the system works.



This region was beginning to recover and it is going to be essential that we make an immense effort to achieve levels of economic, social and democratic security.

Secondly, what we would also like to see is the needs of NGOs being satisfied before a major tragedy occurs.

We must criticise the deplorable attitude of the British Government, but even more so the attitude of the Spanish Government, which maintained a deplorable and shameful silence on this issue until they were forced into a timid reaction by the protests from the inhabitants of the area.
We would, of course, be deluding ourselves if we expected war criminals to accuse themselves.
i agree with jdub
Moreover, would the legalisation of voluntary prostitution not also allow foreign prostitutes to improve their situation in that they would no longer be obliged to work illegally in violent conditions as they are now?

Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action.
The Russian crisis on 17 August 1998 had an enormous effect on Moldova.
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side, the electronic side, of life.

Paragraph 1 - the setting up of a College of European Diplomacy.
The good news is that Mrs Hieronymi has, of course, carried out sterling work and the cooperation which culminated in unanimity within the committee which handled this report was more than excellent.
According to that proposal, Finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from EU countries in stages by the end of 2003.

I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted, it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment, except for the problematic word "more".

Who does one negotiate with in such a situation?
sivang: I expect the stuff that needs plone to be located on the main site anyway
It cannot, therefore, be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights.
Please convey that to the Commissioner please, as she is not listening at the moment.
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.
If the European Union does not act quickly to redress the balance of this situation, both from a demographic point of view and from a social, economic and political point of view, we will be creating an explosive situation for future generations to deal with.
Does the Commission believe that it is important to strengthen the role of NGOs with a view to balancing their presence in Community development policy by comparison with multilateral aid organisations, chiefly those belonging to the United Nations family?

We also congratulate you for using olive oil, which is very good for the health.
roberTO did that for the milk gtk theme  I really like it yeah but was going to make my own pixmap based gtk theme first before considering what metacity to use
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.



We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas.

Madam President, Mr Barón Crespo, Chairman of the Socialist Group, also directed a comment to me.
It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised.





The true value of human life, however, will never be fully understood if we lose sight of God, the Creator of all things, including man.

But in contrast to what is stated in the report, we cannot prevent racism and xenophobia by adopting a unilateral, positive approach to the multi-cultural society as a "source of social vitality" .

Every Member State is by now familiar with this concept, whereby both the defendant and plaintiff have a role to play.

The European Parliament has affirmed on many occasions - for which I am deeply grateful to it - that it shares this commitment.

the what?

I also have memories of other Community institutions.



The majority of countries are beginning a legislative process to prevent violations of people' s fundamental rights, such as the right to private life, and this right is also expressly included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights.




Through its Special Envoy, Mr Moratinos, who has been present the whole time, the EU has of course been able to follow the negotiations in Taba.


Quotas are therefore an important instrument if we are to approach this target.
The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned.
nuh.
So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity, although it does split it into two, nor the amount of aid per hectare.
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.
We should not, however, close our eyes to one political stumbling block in all this.


First of all, this process makes a clear distinction between administrative evaluation and the innovative procedures that we would like to see and that we would like to implement and in which, as has been said, all stakeholders must take part.

Let me just cite one example of this motivation and support.

The Socialist Group requested this Commission statement - I do not know if any of the other groups made the same request.


One final but very important point, you will hear the airlines say that all this is very well but it should be undertaken by ICAO, the international body.
All the groups have reached an agreement to raise 17 questions in relation to certain cases.




I also feel that the reference to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is essential as I think that every proposal ought to take account of the prospect of enlargement.





Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.
As we know, it is a question of quality rather than quantity, which was also mentioned by both Mr Schulz and Mr Swoboda, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group.



This cocktail, which has already been applied in varying degrees in a number of countries, has proved ineffective.



What plans does the Commission have to propose a legal basis for civil dialogue between the EU' s institutions and organised civil society?

However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.
Mr President, 'They died because they looked different, thought differently and lived a different kind of life.' So read the title of an article in a daily newspaper on right-wing extremist violence in Germany.
Since the Commission has not yet received all the additional information it requested, it is not in a position at this stage to give a definite answer to the question as to whether such measures are compatible with Community law.

It would perhaps be a very nice start to the season and the French Presidency if this directive, along with the outcome of the conciliation between the Council and Parliament, in particular, were to be adopted today in Parliament.

We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.

This is often because all the funding available in political terms has already had to be committed to guarantee adequate cofinancing, and rightly so.



Furthermore, in this way, we will achieve for Europe a much more decisive role in the challenge, which is of such concern to us, of creating a fairer, more balanced and therefore more stable world.

It should be easier.

Moreover, this draft regulation concerns us basically because we feel that it is not needed yet.
This situation requires a series of new measures, most importantly aiding victims and prosecuting the people involved in the trafficking in women and children - since it is not just a problem for women, but children as well - for sexual exploitation.


In addition to this, I welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters occurring within our nations has been reinserted in the budget.
It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments, if carried, would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America.
It seems to me that if a spokesman cannot take the trouble to be here for this entire debate and be here on time for his own speaking time he should not be allowed to speak at all.
With the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, the ÅU is now beginning, under the pressure of enlargement and the new order, to address issues which it was unable to solve at previous intergovernmental conferences.

There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.


She is to be congratulated amongst other reasons because, thanks to her presence on the Conciliation Committee, a number of significant factors were introduced allowing Parliament to emerge with the feeling of having won a specific victory, namely the document we are debating today, and not with the sense of having lost a battle over international passenger transport and national freight transport. Rather, it felt the decision had been postponed for strategic reasons.


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.
I must tell you, it is really fun learning a language.

However, the content of the adopted legislative draft has forced us to make a number of critical comments.
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.
Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result.




Finally, we must ask ourselves: how did we come to be in this position?
As far as I am concerned, the European package as a whole could quite easily be fleshed out a little bit and the powers of the European Member States could be increased once again, as long as it is clear what is European and what is national, and as long as we find our way out of the diffuse intergovernmental and Community structure in which we find ourselves at present.
I would have liked to see more on the social economy.

This is probably the first time I have heard delegates referred to as soldiers, but we know what role we are playing here.
It certainly has not become any easier to get the message across that what trade means to us, when it is properly organised, is increased prosperity, worldwide I might add.


The cost of transporting a tonne of goods should not be prohibitive. Furthermore, if we really want to change the present situation, free up our roads and achieve genuine environmental improvements, the cost has to favour the railway.


We endorse the plans of the Commission, which set out to achieve this for each target group and by mobilising the organised midfield.
The exact time will be announced later.

Mrs Díez González, you have asked an important question, but I have to confess that the Council does not have the information you have requested about the number of European Union citizens condemned to death in other countries.


I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.


An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.
JStrike, how? playing solitaire and writing with wordpad?

However, I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package, because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments.

It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.
The Commission mentions this in its report but provides an overview, confining itself to general aspects and not providing a detailed evaluation, so to speak, of the frauds, still less revealing the means used to combat fraud in the past or those to be used in the future.
As regards dioxins and furanes, the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste.

Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.
It is particularly relevant to the debate on the directive that I mentioned earlier that, although the construction industry does not have the highest number of accidents, it does have the greatest number of fatal accidents, comparable only with the road haulage sector.
There is no reason not to do here what we did there, what many of us did in those days.
A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers.
With regard to the legal framework, I believe that there is a paradox in this sector.
They both help to improve people's lives made miserable by Mr Milosevic but they clearly have different triggers and slightly different purposes.
It seems unlikely that a French Presidency, which is highlighting consumer affairs, will take a different view.
Therefore, we understand that the solution that may be presented is not in proportion to the seriousness of the irregularities that the CLONG administration may have committed, and that if a way out of the current situation is not found the NGO Liaison Committee may close.
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.






The citizens of Europe want a thrifty administration and the purpose of the concept of real stabilisation is to achieve a further net improvement in the quality of the work of the Council and the Commission. It should enable us to work even more efficiently in the future in the European Union.
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.
So we need clear yardsticks and data on who pays what and when, and the Community must make a serious effort to get this whole project going.


This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.

The positive results of such activities in the past speak in favour of the continuation of such financial support, which should be made available to every eligible applicant.

Her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work.
The fees must be based on the traffic-related costs arising during transportation in connection with, for example, noise, effects on the environment, risks of accidents etc.
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.
Even more importantly, it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union.

missed him

It is hard to understand how the rapporteur proposes to support small farmers through the measures that he is recommending.
I would also like to make the comment that by replacing cuts in export aid with inward processing and additional procedures the effects will be unevenly spread, in that a heavy burden will fall on the remoter EU countries in terms of transport costs.
Talking about significant developments in the field of trafficking in women at European level, we also need to take a look at the various activities that are, and have been, supported by the STOP programme.
As one well-known analyst said, Europe' s leaders have decided on something that they cannot possibly achieve.
This has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the Commission is grateful for this.
Finally, I would like to say a big thank you for the efforts made in respect of the Gaza hospital.
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.

But that is very well expressed by Mrs O' Toole in her report, so I need not dwell on that point.
They should be able to be confident in all areas and that a whole raft of instruments seems to have been implemented to that end, particularly the White Paper on consumption and food safety.

The next item is the oral question (B5-0556/2000) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Commission, on the poor implementation of certain environmental directives (PCB/PCT, habitats, nitrates).

Have you any idea how soul-destroying it is when a small businessman, with limited access to bank loans, is expected to subsidise companies with a far bigger cash flow or the huge public sector of a country?

The amendments relating to a reduction in the consumption of tobacco products are no more than a pretext, the sole purpose of which is to reduce budgetary spending (approximately 1 billion euros a year, compared with total tax revenues in the 15 Member States of the EU from the tobacco sector of 60 billion euros a year) and, if adopted, will cause huge and irreparable social, political and financial damage to regional economies, especially in Greece.

The Commission is delighted that the Council and the European Parliament have reached agreement.
That is what this framework decision is about.
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.
The drafting of the Charter will certainly be informed by the application of that principle, but it is crucial that the Charter reflects modern European society with all its pluralism and with all its diversity.

Sweden and Finland have been the trailblazers in applying civilian methods to crisis management and in resorting to military action only as a last resort. This is good and will be developed in the future.

The promotion and defence of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and remains one of the fundamental principles of the Union.
This legislation substitutes distributive justice, in a sense, for corrective justice in this very important area of the law of civil liability.

The affair of Mr van Buitenen was conducted completely in compliance with the existing Staff Regulations and however tested, I am sure that any fair-minded person is bound to come to that conclusion.


Mr Katiforis, we shall look into it, thank you.

They will contribute to achieving our goal: the creation of a strong content industry in Europe.
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.



You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels. And these centralists are also, of course, setting their sights on Luxembourg - as a by-product so to speak - for Parliament' s Secretariat.

This also fits in with what was said at the Lisbon Summit, where the Heads of State and Government pressed for further liberalisation of the transport sector.

We have the appalling example of the gold mines in French Guiana, which are laying waste to vast swathes of forest, causing the death of the flora, fauna and the indigenous peoples, which are all suffering from the mercury contaminating their soil, their sap or their bloodstream. This is a phenomenon that is continuing on a daily basis.


Public undertakings and former public undertakings increasingly embrace the commercial world where they, partly with government funding, engage in competition with private undertakings, i.e. their own citizens.

However, this is a possibility provided by the Rules of Procedure, and any Member has the right to avail himself or herself of it.
grabbing updates now
Around the Mediterranean Sea, however, there was preference for payment according to the waste collected.

Allow me to express the wish that is dearest to my heart in the form of an additional question: what special measures will the Commission endeavour to take in the future, with a view to working towards the harmonisation of the social security systems, professional qualifications and the social dimension in all areas?

On this particular issue and regardless of whether we strictly agree with your reading of the situation that the Coptic community is being subjected to specific measures, our information indicates that, even if the Coptic Christians are being affected the most by these repressive measures, this does not point to an attitude of particular retaliation against the Coptic community.

Speaking another European language can clearly be a key to success for those young people.

Thirdly, this is no democratic, constitutional process but a case of a power game behind locked doors.
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.

Who are we then to criticise what is happening now, but we do have grave doubts about the way in which this has been organised.
I should therefore be grateful for your support.

As I have already told this Chamber, while the Swiss Lotschberg-Simplon and St. Gotthard project is making progress, the Turin-Lyons project suffered considerable delays at the planning stage; however, we now have a coherent sense of purpose for this century through the Trans-European Transport Network.

and on the Commission declaration on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.

But I should like to stress once again that the Commission has made provision for a very large sum for Serbia in its proposed amendment to the financial plan for the period up to 2006, and I think that we should send a signal to Serbia, to the political opposition in Serbia, that the European Union is prepared to come up with large sums of aid if and when political democracy becomes a reality.

I feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account.

What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone.
This attitude has led the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to make radical changes to the draft report.



We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do.
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.

It has far more to do with establishing in precise terms, which third-country family members should be entitled to join relations who are immigrants to the European Union.


Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.


My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.

It is also important to create a Community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known. This will enable us to fight more effectively against forest fires and their causes.
Regarding the very difficult question of defining coincineration plant, including cement factories - in connection with the handling of which there has been some quite aggressive lobbying - I want to say that I think we can support Amendment No 43, which I think defines the common position well.

The rapporteur therefore puts himself in the position of defending the most refined form of capitalist neo-liberalism, at which we must protest most vehemently by voting against the report.

I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?

On the basis of a programme of actions proposed by the Government of Guinea-Bissau, the Commission will pay over 50% of the compensation that has been provided for and will pay the balance when the government of that country has submitted a detailed report on the progress of the actions it has proposed and the results that have been achieved.

Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.

The processes of original design are prototyping, testing and making.
I would also express great satisfaction at the fact that the opinion sets a time-frame for developing the single market in important areas, chiefly through the commitment to rapidly create a legal framework for e-commerce.

This is a time of peace in Palestine and Israel: right now the credibility and observance of the legal effect of treaties and agreements is important if the European Union and Parliament want to play an active political role.

It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million. This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.
The compromise contains retroactive measures, and we cannot back a legislative text which alters the rules retrospectively.

2005-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	kergan	in the houry
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.

I know that the European Union and the Commission are working hard to achieve this.

The time-frame currently being proposed, two or three years, is far too long.

There are only two things that will cause them to shift position: pressure from the European Union or pressure from their own public opinion for, unfortunately, the United States is a vast territory and the environs of airports are less badly affected than the territories overflown in Europe, which is, by virtue of its geographical layout, affected more seriously by such constraints.
Mr President, the main conclusion to be drawn is that, in 10 years of Structural Funds, no real progress has been made in closing the huge gap between the per capita income of the richest and the poorest regions of the European Union.

At that time, we will endeavour to obtain the support of all those who want to bring this inhumane embargo to an end and to do so, needless to say, without giving Saddam Hussein' s regime a blank cheque.

There are hospitals, but there is nothing inside them.

A great deal of aid has been set aside for Serbia within the framework of the Stability Pact.


We also agree on our positive assessment of the Commission' s attempts to modernise and reform Community competition law.
That is to say, we need a virtuous policy, but at the same time we are now facing a particularly complex situation in that there are a series of professions who are in a very difficult position and which, as forms of Community-scale protests are developing in Europe, has lead to blockades and disorder and disparate reactions from our governments.
Mr President, I strongly support the resolutions that are on the table before us.


Mr President, Turkey is one of the NATO countries and is applying to join the European Union.

And a progressive Charter of Fundamental Rights will be of no use to Europe if the members of its society have no wish to respect them.
The Community legislation and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice still do not offer a sufficient framework although they are undoubtedly key elements to making further progress in this aspect which is essential to safeguarding the rights of pregnant workers.
We must also take note of the responses of our institution to the observations of the Court of Auditors, and without delay encourage all relevant reform in accordance with the financial regulation and the principle of transparency.

But increasingly, we can also point to many positive developments within the sector.

In order for this to happen, we need to ensure that the appropriate policies are in place to pursue this growth and to ensure that there is choice and access for all.


If you compare prices in the Eleven, that is in Euroland, with prices in other countries which have remained outside the Eleven, including the United Kingdom but also Switzerland and Norway, where this is particularly apparent, you will see that price levels in Euroland, even in the 'rich' countries, are generally speaking lower than in the other countries.
At the moment we know that the Commission has the possibility, the means and the resources, to provide more aid.
Economic recovery is being assisted through a EUR 8.2 million programme of budgetary support and a technical assistance programme supporting improved public financial management.
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet.
Firstly, a diversity of operators is required.

bsd people on the other hand....enjoy the fruits of standardization every single day, too.
We need to look at the likely situation for the rest of this year.
It is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause.


That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child.
Hence, also, the overall resolution to demand of the World Bank that it withdraw its support for our so-called project which would mean the movement of some 60,000 Chinese into an area currently populated by 4,000 Tibetans making a living with their herds, and the exploitation of Tibet's natural resources.
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.

What we are condemning is the hypocrisy involved in speaking of granting aid to these countries and the even greater hypocrisy of claiming to be helping their people.

Many of those small business will have no experience of exporting, they will not have a network of lawyers, they will be uncertain themselves about how they are going to deal with consumer complaints.
That, I fear, was my impression when I came into this job.
I must also speak briefly about the data protection rules within the Schengen Information System.
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.


Madam President, I should briefly like to pay tribute to the work done by our fellow Member, Mr Savary, who has once again shown himself to be a staunch defender of the railways and of public services. Next I should like to tell the people who voted in favour of this report that I, of course, agreed with saying that it is no longer possible to accept the share of rail transport increasingly losing out to road transport, and that nor is it possible to accept the technical, and even regulatory, obstacles from a bygone age that stand in the way of the much-needed freedom of movement throughout the whole of Europe?



And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, as the Commission is doing, in tandem with decision making at a purely European level.
The competent national administrations are by no means familiar with these procedures.

I did not suggest that the decision was referred to the Conference of Presidents, which does not have the authority to decide.
One of the fundamental components of the trade agreement concerns wines, and South Africa committed itself, under the terms of the agreement signed at the Berlin Summit in March 1999, immediately to cease using certain Community designations of origin, such as, specifically, "Port" and "Sherry" , which it had been using illegally for twelve years.


Clearly, we consider that the principle which motivates decisions affecting the citizens is essential and we try to apply it in a systematic way.
Furthermore, the terms "proceed to a formal sighting" can be construed as an obligation for the Community inspection vessel to direct itself towards non-contracting party vessels in order to make a sighting formal.
It is therefore to be hoped that the EU-Tunisia Association Council will assume the responsibility of continuously monitoring the human rights situation in Tunisia by means of a joint action carried out together with the equivalent Tunisian representatives, and that it will create a joint system to monitor the issue which can only bring social improvements to the human rights situation in Tunisia.
Secondly, intermodality is highlighted in my report too.
BSE and dioxin are only the best known watchwords in this area, which repeatedly make many in the European Union flinch and ask questions to which we, as those with political responsibility, must provide answers.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who voted for my report.
Mr President, this proposal has a long history.
The euro must become part of education across the board.



Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.
As it happens, it concerns the policy of a large food processing company which has recently achieved financial results described by the president of the company himself as excellent, and which, at the same time, decided to shed 3 000 jobs and to close several sites in various Member States of the European Union.
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.
Policing of fishing effort in European waters is woefully inadequate, and it is therefore hard to believe that things will be any different in foreign climes.
And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see.
So let us help to ensure that the report on implementation, which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years' time, proves successful.

When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.
I ask the President of this Parliament to write to the military junta in Burma to say: stop the human rights abuses, return to democracy and give freedom to Aung San Suu Kyi.

It should use its role as key donor to urge the Palestinians to end the widespread corruption, which many people protest against and are indignant about at regional level.

I will not bore you with the details - deadlines for transposition, the matter of qualifications obtained in third countries, replacement of the word "similar" by the word "equivalent" and the conclusion of Italian pharmacist studies.
They need to be taken elsewhere; in other words, we do, of course, need to talk to language schools in the candidate countries and we must develop and build up programmes, but we must also, of course, be clear that we cannot anticipate decisions which need to be taken at a political level first.
That is why we insist so much on rigorous enforcement of competition policy in the light of the market situation in Europe, irrespective of the nationality of companies.

The tiny concessions so far offered by the Council lodged in the preamble to this proposal are simply not enough.


Secondly, the railways must be integrated with other forms of transport to achieve a genuine door to door service.
The national diplomats should also be required to attend courses at a college of this kind, so that they understand how to take joint action at European level.

They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.

The Commission welcomes the approach the European Parliament has taken in many parts of the motion for a resolution.
Our own staff policy is outdated.

The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0084/2000) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition 10804/1/1999 - C5-0273/1999 - 1998/0301(COD) (Rapporteur: Mr Staes)

Some years ago we were expelled from the PPE because we advocated a referendum on Maastricht.



The package of proposals that I mentioned before will, therefore, be completed a bit later this year with a proposal for a directive that will cover the issue of temporary residence permits so as to ensure the protection of various victims of trafficking including the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

Policy-makers use analysis undertaken using models developed by the ECB staff, in some cases with input from staff of national central banks, as one input among others into their policy assessments and decisions.

The Commission has proposed a new MEDA regulation and in it asks us for speedier decision-making procedures.
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.
Otherwise we can only endorse Mr Fernández Martín's report; the comments made by Mrs Scheele and others are also a perfect reflection of our own thoughts.
I also want to appeal to my fellow MEPs here in the House to support Amendments 7 and 12 in the vote tomorrow, as the text of these amendments recommends that the campaign not be conducted in countries that have not decided if they are to be a part of EMU.

If - and I say this now completely off the record, insofar as I can in a minuted debate - if, rather than April 2002, it were September 2002 or even January 2003, I would be the last to make a song and a dance about it, but I do want a clear, binding timetable to be adhered to by everyone concerned, including the USA. Once we have all this, then I should like to see it go through the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Authority, the ICAO, in September.
I hope that the Council will follow that lead and ensure that this is transmitted down through the governments to the Member State parliaments.

Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.

Out of the 18 million casualties this illness has claimed worldwide, the majority lived in sub-Saharan Africa, where the average life-span has fallen to under 50 years and will fall still further to 45 years.

I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves.
It is therefore inappropriate to invoke the urgent procedure, particularly as the issue which is to be left off the agenda, is so important.


Today, the Council, Parliament and the Commission are bound by a signed commitment.

Compared to the legislative machinery as a whole, it is only a drop in the ocean.
However, we should at the same time not be naïve.




We therefore welcome the Council' s proposal and support Mr Newton Dunn' s report, which puts forward proposals that improve the text.
The current proposal is a very important step towards doing something concrete about this.

I would also like to stress from the outset that, if we want to boost employment in the European Union, it is of fundamental importance to build on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises for, when all is said and done, they are the hard core of our undertaking in Europe.
We need to allocate much greater resources to education than we have done up until now, both to the workplace and to the public education system, as well as to other areas.
For example, they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B. In this way, they would pay less interest.
We want to try and reduce the gap between science and politics, to endeavour to govern new phenomena secularly together with the pragmatism of experimentation and successive approximations, without immediately launching into prohibitionist campaigns which we already know to be ineffective.
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.


I should just like to tell him that the reform of the international monetary system is on the agenda, as he well knows, and that, clearly, we must combat the instability of the financial markets.
On several occasions since the advent of Dolly we have voted on a number of resolutions.


Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause.
It is important that we in the European institutions, along with Member States, develop effective means of exploiting the potential of regional technologies, to increase both the efficiency and transparency of our interactions with citizens.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.

2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	bob2, you have your hands full


Thus the Commission proposes, before surrendering totally to the United States, a six-year transition period when, in essence, there would be three quotas, including the ACP quota and the dollar quota.
These virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the EU at the moment of enlargement.
But what do we see happening?


Finally, there is the problem of the preliminary question. I do not believe that it needs to be called into doubt in principle, but we can look into its forms.
Like the Commission, Parliament salutes Turkey' s endeavours in drawing up a programme for developing its legal arsenal to comply more closely with the requirements of the European Union, especially in terms of respect for human rights.
Justice which is delayed or which comes too late is, ultimately, always a negation of Justice itself.
We must have dialogue with them and join forces with them, stand at their side in order to offer the people of Austria some alternative prospects.
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Pugio	it's worked ok before
This is one of the 100 000 cases which occur throughout the year on Europe' s coastlines.

The Commission statement on aviation and the environment is a first step towards better European legislation.
This is a complex process which needs clarity and precision at all stages to ensure that the end result is a positive and visible step forward for people in all EU countries.
Today I voted against that discharge.

We need to wait and see what happens there.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Members for their fruitful cooperation.

I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place. They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought.
At present, statements from the Commission' s delegations are too dissimilar because of the divergent positions held by the Member States.

However, the Council must decide unanimously, and I hope that something can be done there.
so looks ok from that aspect
Mr President, the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic.


In this context, complaining that the timetable did not reflect the urgency of the problem is irresponsibly unrealistic.


In our opinion, a Europe which builds its future with constancy, continuity and responsibility is the best guarantee that the founding fathers' blueprint is implemented faithfully, that the endeavours of all those who have worked on it over the past 50 years are at the basis of its success and that Europe is built on solid foundations.


Faith, certainty, dogmas, anathemas, prayers, prohibitions, orders, taboos, tyrannies, wars and glories overwhelmed the order of things.



We must therefore set the correct priorities where this issue too is concerned.
Mr Blokland, the officials of the competent services have informed me that your report will automatically be put to the vote tomorrow.

Another fundamental point is the progress in the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.


If you are in agreement, I would like to proceed with the vote.

Sadly there were, and still are, reservations against including refugees benefiting from temporary protection in this directive, and against recognising same-sex relationships as the basis for family reunification.

The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue, in the final analysis.
It was voted through the last Parliament without any debate.
I cannot, however, make any commitments, Mrs Schroedter, as to what we shall do with the money placed in reserve after 2002 - I mentioned approximately EUR 40 billion - if these countries do not join in 2002. For the time being the funds have been set aside to cater for those accessions that do actually take place.
This has never gone through any committee.


Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.



The NGO platform, with which Parliament and the Commission have maintained dialogue, and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride, and I think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived, when declarations are made saying one thing and then, in reality, practical decisions lead to another.
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.


Apparently the Environment Council was somewhat surprised and even disapproving that we had intruded into their territory and that our intention was to take the environmental inspections recommendation very seriously.

What I would like to see is an equal concern to help with the almost inconceivable social restructuring which will inevitably follow in its wake with - I repeat - 400 million rural farmers out of a job.


Needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements.
When I buy products elsewhere, which are available here in abundance, then of course I cannot assume that there will be no disruption to the market.
For this precise purpose, and in all cases where a citizen of a Member State is threatened with the death penalty in a third country, there is now a coordination mechanism allowing combined approaches to be made to the governments of third countries by the European Union missions in those countries.
The fisheries agreements with third countries therefore fulfil a crucial objective of the common fisheries policy, and they also contribute to employment and, in most cases, in European regions which are very dependent on this activity.


In fact, I wonder what use this "diplomatic pressure cooker" approach has in terms of the final stage of the peace process in the Middle East?
As I conclude, I would like to take you back to the last emotive moment we shared together.
I note what Mr Van Hecke said about the repatriation of a number of English football fans on C130 planes.
I intend to ensure that this paper covers GMOs.
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.

We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.
Mr President, in March, the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which I am vice-chairman, made a visit to Tunisia, where we observed that, while there has been undeniable economic progress, there exists a democratic deficit in the field of freedoms, particularly in the area of the press and the audiovisual media.
Therefore, we will be working from seven until eight.



Every time I go there I have to go through the procedure of getting a visa and the Romanians say that as long as the European Union wants visas from them they will demand them from us.
I just wanted to confirm that you will indeed accept Amendment No 19.
This represented a minimum guarantee of coherence.

There is a lack of legislation, not only in terms of measures to combat the aforesaid mafia, but also in terms of laws to protect the victims.
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.
Turning now to the comprehensive report by Mr Dell'Alba, which concerns the principle of additionality as applied to the Structural Funds, industrial areas, youth employment initiatives, the International Fund for Ireland and the PEACE programme. Here, too, I must confine myself to a few remarks.
For my own part, I am ready to endorse the compromise prepared by the PPE-DE Group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, according to which we shall comply with the Commission' s proposal except with regard to the area of ammonia emissions, as the proposal will not cause great problems for my own country, Finland, or our neighbour, Sweden, as has become evident on many occasions in this discussion.


In fact, in the first six months of 1999, our Parliament considered the first text proposed by the Commission, adopting six amendments and forwarding them to the Council for their consideration.
So while we see on the one hand an increasing demand for closer cooperation with some of our most important partners, on the other, we have lacked the legal framework to be able to follow things up.

I think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee.
If we are to have Community priorities then we must contemplate measures that can be implemented throughout the territory of the European Union for often, within a single state, there are regions that are richer than others and sometimes even within a single region there are areas of exclusion right next to highly dynamic areas - as is shown in the urban audit which I issued a few months ago.
But then there is also the visa obligation which Russia has unilaterally imposed on Georgia since 5 December 2000.


I know that Ministers for the budget of the Member States are not entirely opposed to continuing the use of these oestrogens which, as we know, accelerate the growth of animals, making them grow more quickly.
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.
We are now presented with a solution by this Parliament, by our institutions in Europe, where we want to and can help people where the problem is.

I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.






I think it necessary, however, to highlight the following points which the Commission does not seem to have emphasised sufficiently.


The changes proposed by the European Parliament where best available technology is concerned should mean that all organisations which participate in EMAS should be forced to apply best available technology.




We are, all of us, right across the political spectrum, completely agreed that it is poverty that is the major cause of prostitution and trafficking in women.


An adequate transition period, however, will guarantee that the new requirements are taken account of at the development stage.

I am sure that we will have to continue the legal proceedings against Ireland.
Pozac: You said earlier that compiling isn't needed on Ubuntu.


Nor do they need to feel that they are being branded almost as criminals themselves.
Mr President, "the creation of an ever closer Union among the peoples of Europe and the maintenance and development of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice are based on general and absolute respect for human dignity, which is unique to each person, yet common to all, and inviolable."


What right, then, has the European Union, with regard to the food traditions of some Member States who incorrectly describe products including vegetable fats other than cocoa butter as 'chocolate' , to enforce a change in the very definition of what chocolate is?

tseng: sometimes the text consoles just say byebye
There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed.
In the common position, the Council has now made the text worse in a number of areas, specifically when it comes, for example, to the scope of the directive and the definition of what it is to cover.

In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.

A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.
It may no longer be possible to watch Swedish television as easily in Finland.
Since Parliament has always taken great care to ensure that that CFSP expenditure is an integral part of the Union budget, with the result that it falls within the scope of the Commission budget, we are concerned at the way the Virrankoski report departs from this practice and at the tendency to include CFSP running and operational expenditure in the Council's budget.
This was a cause for great concern.

That is why it is called the Community patent.


However, at this point I feel that it is necessary for the Commission to assume the responsibility of presenting a proposal for reform to Parliament as soon as possible, for we cannot record each year, if not the uselessness, the lack of usefulness of the Centre in terms of political decisions, and then each year, year after year, leave aside the debate and postpone it until the next year.
But is this reflected in the policy?
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination.

If it needs to be pursued beyond the immediate time frame of the crisis situation, it should be taken over as soon as practicable by the regular geographic or thematic Community instrument most suited to manage it in the longer term.
SimonTek,  if i lived thare id sumit one but i am lazy
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.
It is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the European Parliament for its own part should support their adoption.
We might be satisfied with some of the explanations that the Commission offers for these incidents.

It is used to monitor this serious phenomenon and determine the approach to be taken in a multidimensional policy at national and European level.
First of all, however, and before looking back, I wish to take a look into the future.


I therefore ask myself whether treating horizontal restraints and vertical restraints differently will really lead to greater legal certainty, or whether it would not be better for both, to have a block exemption regulation.
Generally speaking, the end goal of measures for which the transition to qualified majority is suggested would not be to harmonise the national legislative systems systematically, but simply to coordinate them.

Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.
He was elected First Vice-President in 1982 and was President from 1984 to 1987.

The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.


Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.
The directive lays down the principles for the introduction of greater transparency, although, in observance of the subsidiarity principle, it leaves the Member States free to adopt appropriate national measures.

We would support action by the Commission to improve cross-border services and honest competition.
The next item is the joint debate on the oral questions:

The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.
The International Coalition against Trafficking in Women reports on town councils buying hundreds of women who are then distributed to the single men in the town on the grounds that they are to be pitied.
We still have an almost purely national framework for justice, although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature.


But I do not think it is right to move that a report is inadmissible because of one paragraph.


That decision was necessary to secure financing for the new political priority, the new highly political task of providing assistance to the Western Balkans region.
I am able to support him on behalf of my group, and I believe it must be possible to reach an agreement with the Council.

(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)


mitochondyu: s'ok.. now you do *grin*


The Council would analyse this proposal with due care.


In this particular case, what foreign policy will this Community diplomatic corps serve?
Trade and cultural relations have to be given priority for economic reasons; a cooperation process needs to be set in motion, but the development of countries which are developing at a slower rate than Western countries also needs to be promoted.
That is why, in connection with Mr Deprez's excellent report, I call on you, when you are debating the freedom of movement and its regulation, not only always to employ a defence mechanism against those whom we supposedly or really do not want here, but finally to realise firstly that freedom of movement is a human right and secondly that it makes economic sense in the European Union.
The Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument.




It is therefore a good cause.

Above all, however, this debate has one fundamental feature.


I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?


The rapporteur believes that only a directive can force the Member States to introduce these inspection systems.

Every year, around 30 million or so people are smuggled into other countries, half a million of whom end up in the European Union.
Deadlines should be set by which a decision must be given in the form of a clear 'yes' or 'no' , so as to avoid any unnecessary risk.
They would prefer to toy with the project of a new ideological division of Europe.

One of the things that the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed is Austria' s full participation in the workings of all of the Union' s institutions.
We have heard a few examples from the HIPC-I and HIPC-II programmes and I understand that 1 billion is tied up in this second programme.
Second, Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events.
Let us remember that EMAS is a voluntary market instrument. Let us remember also that one of the main objectives of the current revision of the regulations is to make the system more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses and also the service sector.

This is why our approach to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is so important, for the very reason that that is where the rules which will govern our all our future activities will be defined, for we cannot hold another Intergovernmental Conference immediately after this one.
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.


Mr President, I believe that Gilles Savary has done magnificent work with these two reports.



However, we are quite active in this field also.
The Council does not have any response to this question at this stage.

does it seem like there are more and more people switching from MS to linux?

As long as the Commission does not adopt a clear, centralised approach to SLIM, the SLIM initiative remains an exercise with no strings attached.
Mr Mulder, you also returned to this point.

The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0006/2001) by Mrs McNally, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment [COM(2000) 18 - C5-0061/2000 - 2000/0033(COD)].
Otherwise, there will be so many people working with no compensation in those countries, so many people waiting, so many administrative costs, and for what?
The honourable Member's report will make a significant contribution to that .
However, I would like to make certain observations which may be useful in this second phase which is so necessary.

ska1 its in hoary
When we talk about the major issues and enlargement, it seems that we are more or less in agreement.
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.
Now, commenting on what Mr Deprez has said, I have this to say.



Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.



They expect major political ambition from Europe, not punctilious regulations of secondary importance.



Given that, according to the statement in Article 5, paragraph 1 of Annex IX to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Community has sole responsibility for conserving and managing marine fish stocks and, by extension, the competence to adopt the relevant rules and regulations, the Commission should make use of these powers and give Greek fishermen exclusive fishing rights within a zone of 12 nautical miles.


Treenaks, i intend to as soon as i move


We provide the most money but nothing is actually being resolved out there, despite the best efforts of all concerned, because the structures are inappropriate.

We are working on assumptions when we present this report from Mrs Haug.
It is essential that we strengthen political, economic and social ties and continue to move forward.

B5-0724/2000 by Mr Hatzidakis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the fires in the south of the European Union;
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals.

At a time when the Union is attempting to create an autonomous military body to enable it to intervene wherever the rule of law is under threat, at a time when the Copenhagen criteria have become an integral part of the acquis communautaire to be assimilated by the candidate countries, it is unacceptable for there to be such discrepancies in the area of human rights within the 15 States.
Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless, there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three.




I should point out that we have moved from regular food aid to structural food assistance and, in particular, the provision of inputs and technical assistance to enhance agricultural production.
someone here makes the theme xfce-dusk  ... who is it?
We should be proud of that and we should make the most of it in political relations also.
These actions are very important and have been implemented in time. The decisions were also taken at the right time.
The mechanism for mutual evaluation by the Member States set forth in the 1997 Amsterdam Joint Action Plan, which - albeit somewhat behind schedule - has become operative, allows us to carry out the first stage.

Is this actually how we want things done?

Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.
We are in favour of assisting young farmers without financial resources to meet the considerable expenses involved in setting up business, purchasing farms and equipment.
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rationale of maximising profits leads to all sorts of aberrations, including feeding herbivores on meat-based meal.

I would appreciate an answer, one I hope will be yes.




The European Union must leave the latter free to exercise their sovereignty in making judicious strategy choices when it comes to energy savings, supplementary forms of renewable energy, the redistribution of freight to the railways and rivers and the development of public transport and the opening up of rural areas.
Of course, the numbers vary from country to country.
The foreign exchange reserves that appear on the ECB' s balance sheet are given in national currencies, while the liabilities vis-à-vis the national central banks are given in euros.
Yet we do not have much time.

better yet /mnt/puss

The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.
yeah

I understand what you are saying, Mrs Read, and the presidency takes note of your comment.
I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that, when the campaign is decentralised, information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of course.


Plan Colombia was not a product of consultation with civil society at a local, national or international level; it was never approved by the Colombian Congress.
"Which weapons do we usually use?" asked the general.
Discussions have certainly never progressed this far before.


Otherwise, we shall see a succession of fatalities next week, for the hunger strike has been going on for months.
I do agree, however, with the ideas underlying Amendments Nos 23, 25 and 26, that is to bring the aid payable for long and short fibres more closely into line and to make the granting of aid dependent on the result of checks.
A condition of this type may have no legal value, but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value.

The second problem is directly linked to the first and yet is of a very practical nature.
I also believe that it is absolutely right that the Commission also wishes to make a relatively large amount of money available if these changes should come about; many people regard such a large amount as being quite appropriate in view of the requirements.
This proposal suggests that, on emotive subjects, the Commission is prepared to act on the basis of that emotion, without the kind of sensible assessment of risk that we need here, as we do for example on risks in foodstuffs.



Ladies and gentlemen, as nice as it would be for the employment situation for our legal profession, it would be an enormous burden for small- and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to take account of the legislation that exists in all EU countries and the signatories to the Locarno Agreement when they are engaged in e-commerce.

This report literally takes a refreshing look at the problem, and not before time. The rapporteur is to be congratulated on this and the report can count on the support of the liberal group.

I therefore believe that a comprehensive enquiry should be instituted into all the abnormalities which occur locally and in the national armies.

Coordination of the Member States' responsibilities is necessary if countries are in practice to be able to pursue generous policies on refugees.

But it was up to the Americans to do that - Radio Free Europe was created at the time by the Americans.
Mr Hatzidakis, you tell me more money will be needed.


Mr President, esteemed Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the debate on EURODAC and the implementation of this system is something of a never ending story.

- (DE) I voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons:

We need high minimum standards and, in particular, we need those standards in the light of the accession of candidate countries, many of which are more reliant on nuclear technology than existing members of the Union and have much older generating capacity.

Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time.
A common position was finally adopted on 29 May last.



A special effort must be made on behalf of the European film industry, and that is something the Liberal Group supports.

and open it in xmms
As Mrs Schroedter has already mentioned, we are asking the Commission to make a huge effort and employ a great deal of creativity in order to help the towns in Serbia which support the opposition.

Measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes.

(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)

Unfortunately, in terms of human and technical resources, the European Commission is, in our opinion, currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve, or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet.

However, that does mean that we have a problem in the short term, namely what we will be doing this coming Friday.


I therefore hope that, in future, the collection of customs duties in Europe will work well too.
We hope, of course, that it will need to be deployed as little as possible, but that is wishful thinking.
We particularly empathise with the emotional turmoil and anxiety they are experiencing.

i use cable



The complaint was also rightly voiced that the corresponding agreement between the Member States has only been ratified by a few Member States.
Here I need only mention mobile telephones.


However, this effort must be matched on our side by considerable political generosity, expressed in many different ways.



that's the shame of irc, nothing of it goes into the archives, such as google and co. ;|





That is what the rapporteur has been striving for.

I simply wanted to stress that at Feira we expressed a desire to see the framework encompass non-allied countries and those countries that are not members of NATO and, if it is indeed this type of flexibility to which you refer, it will undoubtedly be implemented.





yea
Mr President, Commissioner, we must be very careful as Europeans about taking issue with separatist movements of the kind being discussed here.

I therefore argue that we should move ahead with the coordination of economic policies, making reference to the Member States' obligations.

But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.
Secondly, apart from the formal exchange of correspondence the Commissioner mentioned, what serious action has it undertaken with regard to the United States Government on this matter and with what outcome?
Subject: Iraq and the lifting of sanctions Will the Council, under the Swedish Presidency, indicate what level of priority it attaches to the situation in Iraq and, in particular, will it make a clear commitment to press for the lifting of sanctions affecting the health and welfare of men, women and children?
Now the Commission is saying that there is no longer enough money, however, because we entered into a commitment in Marrakech and now we are going to have to rethink the situation.

The Treaty of Amsterdam has made respect for human rights one of the main objectives of the EU' s common foreign and security policy.
However, that is not the problem.
According to the International Chamber of Commerce, the cost of counterfeiting represents between 5 and 7% of world trade.




Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.

I would also very much like to back Mr Goebbels' remarks about the importance of enlargement, namely that we should not have two standards - one for us and one for them.


But, of course, this is what we are going to support.

Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.




[Phaedrus] : try asking on the user list
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.

We all recognise the importance of this debate and this exchange of views has clearly been influenced by the emotions caused by the Dover tragedy.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?
In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours.


There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself.
The definition of indirect discrimination will enable covert action which is more pervasive, more insidious to be challenged and will permit implementation by genuinely independent bodies with sufficient funds to do their work so that our words are turned into reality.
At least, everything was done to defuse the different justifications for war in the framework of an ad hoc stability agreement.

The fact remains that the agricultural policy is, in principle, there for the benefit of farmers.

The Centre must become significantly better in this area than it is at present.
They are also looking into a complaint against France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and finally, we are also investigating a UMTS auction under the state aid rules.

We consider this desire to increase road safety to be all well and good, but this is not an issue in which the EU should be investing resources. Rather, it is an issue which is best dealt with at Member State level.


He and I sometimes cross swords on the issue of other nutritious additives, but in this case we are looking very much at the essence of the burden of proof before this list is yet further extended.
This initiative will complement the already existing directive in this field, which was adopted in 1998.


The importance of European Union action in this matter is that it will be a confidence-building measure, and what the public want are confidence-building measures.
Although the own resources are falling, they are still an important source of income and it has now been decided that certain Member States are allowed to retain 25%.

We cannot continue this discussion any further, but I promise you that we shall clear this up in the Bureau, first of all so that every President of the sitting applies the same rules for the explanations of votes.

I think that the image of farming - due to the many outbreaks of disease, dioxin scandals etc - is, at the moment, one of the really major problems.

At the Seattle Summit and then at the Davos Summit, the people of Europe have been able to observe the inability of the WTO to reconcile financial priorities with their own priorities, which are living conditions, working conditions and the quality of the goods they consume.

Clearly, it would be extremely useful to be able to quickly have the confirmation of final rulings against defendants or criminals who have already been convicted, at a wider level within Europe, but computerisation would already be a good basis - not necessarily on a huge scale - since information technology should now make it possible for us to achieve significant results quickly.

The supply situation has deteriorated dramatically.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I actually think it is a shame that you have had to invest so much time and energy in this issue, because as Mr Blokland said, we are spending all our time looking back at regulations from the seventies instead of looking to the future.
As long as support for processors continues to be varied according to whether the crop concerned is short- or long-fibre, we can do away with this differentiation in the support for producers.

Mr President, Mrs Muscardini' s report on Mediterranean policy, or what claims to be a report on this subject, stands out, first of all, for one simple reason but one that is always disregarded in this Chamber.
I can refer to a letter from the organisation that represents the motoring clubs across Europe, including, for example, the AA and RAC, who are broadly sympathetic and supportive of our work, because they know that unless Europe takes a lead on this issue, unless we begin pulling together the best of the ideas from across the European Union, then the cities, towns and rural areas, will continue to suffer from unacceptable levels of congestion and pollution.
And if it has a good beginning and if we are able to follow up the issue, then it will only be natural for us to increase the amount concerned so that the Fund really can live up to its name as the European Refugee Fund.

This great truth emerges from a fact rather unknown to most, that in the English language, for example, there are at least 75 000 words of Greek origin.
I have listened carefully to the points of view presented and noted that the criticisms made on a number of points are justified.
This is not the whole answer to the problem, and we will continue to find better and quicker ways of responding.

Blackwell: Yeah, guess that's true.
We also call on the Canadian authorities to behave in accordance with NAFO control measures and not to exceed their authority. During the plenary sitting on this matter, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President of the Commission, acknowledged that they had exceeded their duties in appropriating the ship' s documentation without the authorisation of the captain of the vessel.



We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.
Despite all that, at the end of the day, this money, which is supposed to assist the local people, will, even so, be better employed over there than the money given to major employers over here who are shedding jobs.
Queiró, Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, to the Council (B5-0210/2000);

lemme check
Mr President, I should like to say that I cast a vote in error yesterday afternoon on the question of referring the bananas issue back to committee.


(Applause) The Commission has absolutely no intention - and it was most certainly the very last thing I intended - of introducing any new political conditions into the negotiating process or the decision-making process.

Those are the bases for the draft budget for the financial year 2001, drawn up by the Council on 20 July, to provide for EUR 95.9 billion in commitment appropriations, an increase of 2.7% over the budget for 2000, and EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations, an increase of 3.5% over the budget for 2000.

Moldova imports all its raw materials from abroad and is very dependent on energy imports.



yes. why ?
I know this was far from being your intention, Commissioner, but that is the impression people got and it must be dispelled!

These are questions which we are still left with.

We have used existing structures to convene a meeting of an independent group of experts under the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences in general of exposure to depleted uranium.
I wish to draw our fellow MEPs' attention to a demonstration which is leaving Brussels today for Paris and to ask them to exercise the utmost vigilance where this is concerned.


I am quite prepared to believe that 15 heads, or 15 sets of data across the Union, will help us achieve better quality in the schools.
Mr Liese, you very cleverly associated your speech to one of the Rules of Procedure to make it look like a procedural motion, but I have to say the connection was tenuous.

To summarise, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group believes in advancing towards common security actions, provided we do not get boxed into a rigid institutional system, but instead establish flexible procedures based on voluntary input and respect for national sovereignty.
I hope that these documents will answer many of your concerns in relation to the realisation of the goals of e-Europe, but it may be that some of the issues will not be addressed, because we must try to remain focused in this initiative.

With this in mind, the European Judicial Network was established in 1998 through a joint action. It has started its work and is developing many activities to make legal assistance and the exchange of information easier.
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.

Mr President, as we can deduce from the speeches by the rapporteurs, and at this stage it is hardly necessary to repeat it, the Mediterranean region must be one of the European Union' s highest priorities, because the problems of the southern Mediterranean - the political upheavals, the economic stagnation, the population growth - affect us, directly or indirectly, as Europeans.


Naturally, the intention is not to squander subsidies. Indeed not.

lostmonk, do you mean like outlook express?
yes, it was
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.

The so-called institutional revolution, which lasted seventy years, has ended.

More specifically, I should also like to acknowledge the encouragement given to the French Government by Pervenche Berès and Klaus Hänsch, as well as the ambition sought by some speakers, such as Mr Watson. I would also like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit with regard to the vision that drives my government and which has perhaps made an effective contribution to certain positions.





And, the two hour time-scale, even more ludicrously, was supposed to save them from a car parking fine in the local car-park!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a directive intended to fight marine pollution, and this will not be the only one this year.
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.


We really cannot tolerate behaviour of this kind!
He had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds.

It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.

For these reasons, Mr Turco' s report on the 1998 annual report on such important financial instruments as the Structural Funds is also relevant, since it opens up the possibility of strengthening the effective and decentralised application of those Funds and also because it opens the way for discussion and reflects the specific situation of these outermost regions with regard to establishing criteria for admission to the Structural Funds and their inclusion in Objective 1.
It does not, however, empower any of the institutions to enter into expenditure commitments to support European political parties, nor does it provide for a procedure for approving any measure to facilitate the giving of such an expenditure commitment.
I should, however, state that to date, the Council has not received a single scientific report establishing a link between these illnesses and the use of depleted uranium weapons.
The European dimension of the fight against terrorism is not, however, a recent concept.
(time to upgrade)

My Group would be very unhappy about such a proposal.

Does the Commission support the Council?
I believe we should think about the real causes behind this incomprehensible fact.

As a citizen of the country in question, I do not object to this modus operandi.


hopefully i get the computer soon

I am sure, Mr Hager, that you share the anxiety of these families.
martin_, go read here https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
This need is all the greater in that those who are in contact with the law and justice are often unfamiliar with the rules of Community law.
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.
One is led to believe that lower costs as a result of liberalisation only have benefits.

I would stress that I particularly welcome the fact - and that is why I voted for this decision - that no more budgetary restrictions are to be imposed on Greece, for, sadly, the brunt of this could not fail to fall upon pensioners and the elderly, in this case Greek pensioners and elderly people, who would be the victims of the exacerbation of the situation as regards the country' s budget, for Greece is willing to further reduce the negative elements of the Maastricht criteria and we have recommended that it do so, even though it does already fulfil these criteria, as has been stated.

This year, the provisions of the new interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 have taken full effect.

In consideration also of the existence of the Stability Pact, we need to take practical steps to show that the enlargement of Europe will also mean greater security for our people.

I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.
I supported Portugal as well as I could there at King Baudouin' s Stadium in Brussels, but France won in the end in a match in which it has to be said that France had the better team.
I hope we can have some clarification.


The stabilisation and association agreements to be signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are the keystone of that approach.

However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.
The approach that the Commission has adopted with regard to sport is defined in its Helsinki report.
For example, we have been talking about the Roma.

We are therefore talking about a dreadful case of a lack of professional ethics, which has done enormous economic and public relations damage to the company concerned, but this case had no implications whatsoever in terms of the safety of workers or the public.
There are problems with the diversity of instruments and the duplication of procedures, but the real problem is the lack of political will.
I supported Amendment No 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16.
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.
Reprocessing by its nature produces large quantities of liquid waste.
I share your view, Mrs Karamanou, that the incidents mentioned appear, at first sight, to indicate a general problem of security and public order in Albania rather than a campaign of deliberate attacks on the Greek minority.

As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.

Whereas, perhaps owing to my curious accent, it was transcribed as "biannual" , which would require two reports a year and would be over-egging the pudding!
This is why the new agreement that we are now deciding on is so important, because it, in fact, brings cooperation one step further forward and clarifies priorities.

The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome: dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society, and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller.



We cannot watch from the wings while Europe consistently lags behind the United States and other global challengers.
I await with interest developments in Cuba.

However, these must be combined with speed and efficiency.
This problem cannot be solved through national measures.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.

I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.
Fifty-seven percent of Erasmus students had considerable difficulties financing their stay abroad.


Whether the price drops again in the short term is of no consequence because there will be a steady upward trend in the long term.


I would like to focus once more on two particular points.

Mr President, Mr Prodi' s Commission will not last for five years because people will not, in the longer term, put up with detailed regulation from Brussels.


We must get the programme of Trans-European Networks, as proposed in 1994, back on track, we must initiate a major research and development programme in order to ensure that investments necessarily have an innovative content.

Within the relevant frameworks, the Council will offer the democratic powers every encouragement to guarantee that voters have a real and credible choice of candidates.

Commissioner, Vice-President, I hope that after the vote tomorrow you will peruse all the drafts for the White Paper on transport policy again and check whether they follow the same lines as proposed by this House.
We do not want financial control to be abolished.
We also have a clear commitment on the ninth EDF and the financial perspective.

In Germany we have a saying which runs: "when I don' t know what to do next, I appoint a committee".


The scenarios can vary a great deal.

Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.
We have therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that investment in the roads sector should not represent more than a quarter of all investments in transport sector infrastructure so that it will be possible to comply with the guidelines for budget item B5-7, which deals with trans-European networks.

Of course, the Charter of Human Rights is the first step in this direction, but, as with everything which characterises the construction of Europe, the approach is indirect, concealed, tortuous and, I might even say, 'Jesuitical' .
Another factor is the exclusion of initial training: Amendments Nos 12, 110, 111 and 112.
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.



It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us.
This is not the way things are done.
They do have freedom of speech.

In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.
its like a laundry list of the programs those repos. know about
I can assure you that the Commission is doing everything it can to achieve this, which is why we submitted the action plan, containing specific measures with specific deadlines and which is why we are completing revising the financial regulation and I shall shortly be reporting on this to Parliament.

The Commission will make a statement on the notification of the relevant Member State, after consulting employers and workers at European level, as well as representatives of the Member States.
Let me repeat what I have already told this House: I shall not sign any programming document for any European region in relation to regional policy, for which I am responsible, unless it includes a very clear plan for access to the information society for this region and for each region, and I do not mean access programmes exclusively for people of primary, secondary or higher education age.





Pozac: so let them make the policy they need for pro support and enjoy the benefit you get from the freeness of their distro ;)
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, it is important that President Herzog appears before the European Council in Feira.

Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.



I shall give Mr Goepel the floor and then we shall proceed to vote on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s proposal to postpone the vote until tomorrow morning or Thursday morning.






(A5-0183/2000) by Mr Bourlanges on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on draft supplementary and amending budget 1/2000 to the budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2000;


The EU aid policy is determined by the fifteen Member States and financed by contributions from the Member States, as established in the EU Treaty.
I am afraid I cannot follow this either.



There are considerable infrastructure needs, not to mention environmental challenges.


However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.

Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.
The EU must adopt a credible and independent policy in this area, but it is important to retain the commitment of the United States and the transatlantic link.
This Assembly has also demonstrated its vigilance faced with the difficulties of application that exist in several Member States and in many spheres of activity.



Four hundred million was the budget proposed by the Commission back in 1995, and unfortunately the Council rejected that proposal.

Mr Fischler, the European Commission must not continue to ignore the requests of the sectors affected.


A few years ago, the magazine 'Nature' featured a study into a Peruvian forest and the best way to exploit it.
Mr President, the proposal for a regulation under discussion does not aim to address the problems, as the Commission hypocritically claims, but to cover up the problems which have arisen in certain countries, thereby generalising them and making them everybody' s problem.
We therefore endorse the key points of the Commission proposals.
I am of the opinion that we work to live and not the other way round.
In Germany there is a new Government, which will not necessarily feel that it would lose face by reversing the rejectionist stance of its predecessor, so perhaps we can now hope for a more conciliatory response.

The consequences do not inspire hope.


The use of waste products and excrement in food production is the logical consequence of a senseless agricultural policy, which undoubtedly has to be brought to an end right here and now.

A situation which must be prevented and which I would like to consider is that of the new type of work via the Internet, teleworking, part-time work, which can be an easy breeding-ground for undeclared work.

Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.



Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my delegation intends to back the Skinner report on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time the Directive concerning minimum health and safety requirements.
The fourth point I want to make concerns medical expenses, or the possibility of benefiting from provisions for medical care in another Member State.
We have repeatedly stated this position to the Israeli authorities at every official meeting between the Commission and the relevant Israeli minister, the most recent of which was held on 21 January. On that occasion, the Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, attended a meeting with Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, and with Commissioner Patten.
We have agreed arrangements without difficulty to take part in all the post-Helsinki structures, such as the interim Political and Security Committee, with one exception.
We have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go.

With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.



The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.



We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.
Would more people join, become active members and take part in debates in connection with elections and decision-making?
On the basis of the information provided in the report, how does the Commission intend to react, what policies will it pursue and what measures will it take to safeguard Europe from the environmental threats it faces?
Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo.

The existing large and small national airline companies have become more profitable and have started to operate more efficiently without government funding.


Prozac: ctrl-alt-f1 took me to the console yeah


The other provisions of the directive relating to daily and weekly rest breaks, annual leave and nightwork will, of course, apply to junior doctors after a three-year transposition period just as they do for all other workers.


If someone, be it a person, a country or a group of countries, considers that it has no initiative to act, it loses interest, neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties, but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily.
Firstly, Mr Theonas, I do not agree with the comment that the Council presidency is not explicitly answering the questions raised by Members. In fact, quite the contrary is true.
Red Guards would accuse intellectuals of bourgeois thinking.

yay

Since 1957, the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community has contained provisions designed to guarantee the free movement of workers within Community territory.
So, the reform of programmes like MEDA goes right to the heart of what we are trying to do in the Commission.
Minister, I believe that Parliament may be able to take a stance on this matter which opposes what you have said today.

Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.
then check the iso md5sum

It is therefore urgent that we establish harmonised standards at Community level so that we can have comparable data and assess the results of preventive policies in each European State, community or region. We must do this to ensure that we do not have first- or second-class workers, or lower, but that all workers are protected by safety regulations and requirements of the same quality.


If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.
However, I believe that the departure of Clinton has meant that, for the moment, United States diplomacy in the region will be less active.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam has facilitated this new approach to European policy on asylum and migration, which, as Mr Oostlander has already pointed out, requires a degree of solidarity between Member States, and there should therefore be mechanisms designed to contribute to finding a balance between the work undertaken by Member States who receive these refugees and their being able to bear the short- and long-term consequences of welcoming these people.
We need to invent new responses and new social attitudes.

but its been on my viao laptop for 2+ months now
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.
These modest enough resources should not be watered down further by the inclusion of secondary objectives.

We should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it.
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.



Mrs Kinnock, I thank you for your words.
The "Texts Adopted" also form part of the Minutes.
yea
The point has been made repeatedly today that the world drugs problem must be tackled at its roots.

Finally, considering that there is a clear need for a common foreign policy displaying Europe as a coherent system capable of undertaking united initiatives, does the Commission not feel that it would be appropriate to create a structure to study this issue, which would work together with the local Churches, NGOs and civil society and act upon the conclusions reached?
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?

A total of EUR 19 million is about to be released for a micro-projects programme which in the interests of consensual policies has been delayed until after the elections.

In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.





ahh ok.
I believe that Haider is, and we must recognise this, expressing his contempt for the sanctions that the European Union is currently imposing on him as it was when the Portuguese Presidency took the initiative of proposing the nomination of three wise men that he decided to retaliate by demanding a referendum on lifting sanctions, a completely demagogic, populist and anti-European referendum.



These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants.

I voted for the motion partly because pensioners and the elderly are among the most frequent victims of this type of forgery - as always the prime targets - in the hope that, when we return to the issue, a decision will, at last, be taken to acknowledge that when a citizen is the victim of a crime the State is liable, albeit indirectly, in the same way as it is at football matches.
The southern Mediterranean countries need European aid, aid that demonstrates solidarity and which contributes to the development of their society. This aid must also reduce the disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, by putting an end to the existing relationship of economic domination, the most obvious and most unfair example of which is perhaps the system maintaining national debt.
EU cooperation is, in the first place, a civilian European project and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation.
That does not, however, detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report.
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.
With regard to the follow-up of the Decker and Kohl judgments, there are important legal questions currently being debated in new cases before the Court.
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.
They ask us where their children are, their sons.
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.

We are currently succeeding in reconciling the problems of economic coordination, the major objectives of economic policy, the problems of coordination in social terms, the guidelines for employment and the various methods, and the various bodies working on it.
The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with, and interest on the part of, the European Parliament and the Council.
Madam President, Mr Hänsch made an important observation a moment ago and, since his point forms part of the agenda as a whole, I would like to add my thoughts as well.
But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders, deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade.
Unless we therefore consider that they benefit...
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.
Pozac, That's what gentoo's for. I just don't want a source-based distro on a PII 233. :)


Mr Patten has listed a number of measures the EU has taken to help.

The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.
In order to achieve this, a South-East regional group was set up together with a working group on economic reconstruction that also encompasses trade relations.
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.




We require a far more formal decision-making procedure of a parliamentary type.


2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: from the 'universe' repo?

Over the past few years, the Union has repeatedly stressed the need to respect the integrity of Iraq and its border with Turkey.

Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.
the--dud: yep, it is.....thats why hoary just gets switched to utf8 everywhere
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.
These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo.







For the reasons which have been expressed, and which I would probably just be repeating: this initiative takes account of one aspect, the most repressive one, but that is only one aspect of the problem.

A tripartite working group, comprising Palestinian and Israeli specialists as well as those of the Commission, should thus be set up.

The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used.
Once we have successfully implemented this conciliation, we shall also have opportunities to create a better environment in Europe, and in that way we are serving all citizens.


My question is quite specific. Do you consider, given the spirit of the Helsinki resolutions, which call on Turkey to settle its border and similar disputes with its neighbours by 2004, that the status of the island rocks or grey zones in the Aegean counts as a border dispute?
We discussed our priorities well in advance both among ourselves and with the Commission, and we adopted our guidelines well in advance, including for Category 3.




It is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the Treaties regarding our working venues, although it is not an intention that I share.



I know he has tabled amendments in relation to that.


The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.


With what targets are we to start?


The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.

There is no room for amendments.
The most interesting parts of his work are surely those which refer to the subject of the report, that is to say 1998, and OLAF, the body which is presenting its first piece of work.
Apart from in this final note, I made my contribution on behalf of the entire Group of the Party of European Socialists.

But for the time being I would like comments to relate to the Minutes, so that we can adopt them.
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.


The UK has a low proportion of electricity from renewable sources, I believe amongst the lowest.


What would be the point of having more than 40 000 officials in more than 1 500 diplomatic missions between the Commission and the Member States - twice the number the United States has - if our activity really is not sufficiently efficient, coherent or visible?






There are ten in our delegations at the moment, with a few more due in the near future.
Once again, I should like to express my thanks to the honourable Members who have taken the floor, and especially to Mrs McNally for her splendid work. I trust we shall all reach agreement at the earliest opportunity, if possible at first reading.
This does not end the problems caused by cars and lorries.



We would actually like to emphasise that there are three priorities for which we need to find a balance simultaneously. Firstly, of direct concern are our neighbours, in other words eastward enlargement.




My second question is about the Employment Summit.

In the shorter term, for pragmatic reasons, we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme.
I therefore appeal to the sponsors of these amendments to consider withdrawing them.
In my view, this is all part and parcel of the good governance to which the countries of Africa have committed themselves if they are to receive more development aid.

That conflict demonstrated the potential political effects of instability on the neighbouring States, threatening to destabilise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Albania and Montenegro.

Mr President, it is a positive step that the draft law on the trial of the Khmer Rouge members in Cambodia has been adopted in the country' s National Assembly and that King Sihanouk is to sign it after it has been discussed by the Constitutional Council.
and i didn't follow what cef was saying.


It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.
Mr President, Parliament has asked me to make a statement on the transfer system and on the whole panic which has gripped the world of sport and which the press has been echoing.

Poverty, a high level of illiteracy, massive unemployment, particularly among young people, extreme inequalities and an increasing technological deficit compared to Western countries.
People became ill having been to the Balkans, just as they did after the Gulf War.
To conclude, the assessment of our Presidency will be made here next week by the Portuguese Prime Minister.

I support these demands which are contained in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
As is evident from the amendments, the battle is not over yet, not by a long shot.

It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.

I am also grateful for the authoritative comments made by the honourable Member, Mr Carraro, and by representatives of other relevant committees during this debate and the other contributions we have had as well.
Up until now, measures have consisted of reductions in quotas, minimum mesh sizes for nets and fishing bans in certain periods.

We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.
So what is this Charter for?

It would probably have taken until the end of the last century to disburse the Marshall Plan aid.
The Portuguese Presidency has put the social dimension of innovation very firmly on the agenda, but I think that this dimension is still too far removed from the intentions to promote new activity.

We think the issue needs to be examined country by country to ensure adequate analysis adapted to each case.

It is reasonable to expect Member States to produce the sort of detail that is necessary for the European Commission both from the management point of view as well as that of accounting, to have exact details of where and to whom the money is going, down to the last recipient.
The Commission is obviously on the right track.
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?




Perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened.
Greece is going through a period of transition which, I would say, equates with the first period of the policies concerning its accession to EMU.

For now, I just want to say that we call for a more active, more substantial role to be played by the European governments, giving the High Representative the power to develop a policy which is not in conflict with or an alternative to the policy of the United States, but is much more substantial than the strategy currently employed by Europe with regard to the partners, whose job, I regret to say, we cannot do for them.


Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.

I should like to thank the numerous speakers who have expressed their thoughts, all of which were extremely useful, and particularly those who spoke in French, although it is not their mother tongue.
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.
The market can also be stimulated now, thanks to our collaboration with the European Investment Bank and the creation of a venture-capital fund for multimedia businesses.

It is essential that identical labelling rules are applied to beef imported from third countries.
I consider that, by exhorting our colleagues, and also the Groups, to be present, we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about a positive outcome.

As I explained in my speech yesterday, this fund is not specifically intended to handle infrequent, exceptional and tragic instances of influxes of refugees originating from crisis-stricken countries, but to handle the day-to-day distribution of appropriations for the management of the usual flow of refugees of all kinds towards the most developed countries.
That independent authority is important in the agreement. We are of course referring to the railways, attempting to promote them.
That would be a very dangerous mixture of unrelated things and would pave the way to the generalised practice of financial blackmail, a blackmail that is all the more inadmissible in that, as we must remember, the money from the Structural Funds remains above all the product of the contributions the Member States pay into the EU budget.

This bill has not yet been adopted.

The Veltroni report on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is certainly an improvement on the Commission communication on the 'principles and guidelines for the Community' s audiovisual policy in the digital age' .

We are not, fortunately, at this point.
We call upon the Convention on Fundamental Rights, the 62 politicians that David Martin mentioned, to take up this task.

The least both parties could do is to impose an absolute freeze on military activity.


The attack happened in Catalonia about three or four kilometres from my house and it appears that the situation is worsening since, even though ETA have already killed more than 800 people, they have committed yet another atrocity, even as we speak.
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.
In the few seconds I have left, I want to address the Commission directly with the request which, among others, Mrs Thors and Mrs McKenna mentioned in connection with the transport of livestock, instances of which occur every day within the Union and which are perhaps the most obvious environmental crimes we face today.
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	krischan	guys, an XMMS-related question: how do I enable XMMS to play back MIDI files? I heard about the 'xmms-midi' plugin, but I can't find it in Ubuntu's repos.

At the moment, however, this sends out the wrong psychological message to the markets and citizens who, to use an appropriate metaphor, look upon the euro descending Mount Olympus with sadness in their eyes.
I accept the rapporteur's proposal - we came to an agreement on this today - that an oral amendment be moved tomorrow in order to make it clear that we also accept the compromise on the involvement of employees and their representatives, in other words the reduction of such involvement to the works level.
We must identify and seek where possible to remedy them.

I recognise that you are probably not in a position to answer them this morning, but I hope very much that you will send me answers when you have them, as soon as possible please, relating to the actual, technical implementation of the agreements in relation to goods.

We need more and deeper study for that purpose.
I have also done my homework and I do not want to mention any names, but we will be able to do this in future.

In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.


you're wellcome fumanchu
The disease has been identified since 1986, but nothing much was done until 1996.

Quite simply because the WTO, according to the Marrakech model, does not permit this, or permits it only with extreme difficulty.

Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.
This should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects.
Unfortunately, however, it would appear that the Swedish Government has not properly understood what is meant by a civil peace corps but believes that other measures under way are the same as a civil peace corps.


It is still unclear whether a resolution on China is to be adopted in this year' s session.

I should also, however, like to thank Mr Pirker and Mrs Palacio.

The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration.
I am still not quite clear about your answer and would just like to ask whether you think that governments in neutral countries are being somewhat economical with the truth?

As these two approaches are made, this two-pronged approach by the European Union and the United States is, in my view, the best way to start the process for long-term peace and stability in this region.
If we adopt an attitude, we cannot express any indignation at waste while at the same time putting forward a budget of this type.

On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused.
It seems essential to me, since we want an area of free trade and prosperity, and since we also want to push decisively for democratisation in this area in the southern Mediterranean, that we support the men and women who are trying to work in this field.
They have to give us answers and provide us with information.

In seeking democratic support for this historic enterprise, we are certainly not attempting to delay the process but to reinforce it.
In the foregoing, my aim was certainly not to trivialise the suffering of the Palestinian people.
Surely we should be able to come up with the goods and establish that there is indeed reduced dependency on aid.

In other words, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, in Europe, the European Convention.

Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.

For example, the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months.

We have taken the political decision, but we now want to see the sector send us a signal that it is about to launch into further development.
The most important objective is surely to create and develop a European democracy and to eliminate the democratic deficit.
Madam President, I should like to start where Mrs van der Laan left off.
I made a very simple request to the President on Monday.
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.
As for women' s rights and human rights, I hope that some progress can be made at the Intergovernmental Conference.

So how far have we come?
For all these reasons, I can fully accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, and 4 by which Parliament reintroduces the original provision on safeguard procedures.

Even in the peak years at the beginning of the 1990s, when we were implementing the internal market programme, we only had a third to a half of the labour costs now being proposed by the Commission and we must organise our work more efficiently and provide the resources so that we can carry out our work accordingly.


It was also mentioned by Frau Gebhardt that the cloning of human beings should be forbidden.
I am not particularly confident but we shall watch to see how that goes.

She has been a great rapporteur and it is thanks to her that the draft Parliament is submitting to us today is a draft which improves the Commission' s text.
Finally, perhaps this report will at some time enable us in this Chamber and in the Union to have a rational and reasonable debate on immigration and visa issues, decoupled from the ugliness of nationalism and xenophobia.

European film production is an important part of the EU' s cultural and media policy, and the Liberal Group considers that it is important to support the European film industry which is exposed to a very great deal of competition, especially from the American film industry.
Mr President, my Group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme. However, we have some concerns about the process.

So we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well.


I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.
This is the level at which improvement programmes need to be drawn up in the areas of education, housing and employment. They must be organised in such a way as to ensure that the entire population benefits.


And when Sarah Ludford says the report refers to the year 2000, then she must be clairvoyant because it has only just begun.

Hi

We welcome the EU' s increased opportunities to pursue a credible foreign and security policy so that the EU can assume increased responsibility when it comes to solving conflicts in the vicinity of the EU.
Madam President, we know President Kuçan and we are aware of his regard for Europe and the good relations which have been established between Italy and Slovenia.

Now, I have as little sympathy for Islamic militants as many others in this House, especially when they adopt the fundamentalist approach much in evidence in these regions and also manifested today in the debate between the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian Parliaments.

It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.
ok, tb on jan 4th
The reports from Italy, Belgium, Spain and Finland are also ready, but as yet unofficially.
Will the Commissioner consult Mr Bolkestein to do something about this?
We are living in a Europe that is increasingly closer to its citizens and therefore we cannot omit to concern ourselves with employment, as employment, together with health, is one of the main concerns of the citizens and, I dare say, especially of those who are unemployed because they have lost their job or perhaps never had one.
I would call on you to fight the establishment of this Parliament, the establishment within your own groups and not to consent to this framework agreement tomorrow.


what i syntax do i need
Mr President, it is more than 50 years since we adopted the Declaration of Human Rights, but we probably need to ask ourselves whether the human rights situation has in actual fact improved.
Subject: Hunger strike by political prisoners in Turkey The spectre of death is haunting dozens of political prisoners in Turkey who have been on a hunger strike to the death for the past two months in protest at the inhuman conditions in Turkish prisons.


They will be making recommendations on our future efforts.

However, we would also wish to go further in a different direction.

This document has meant that forestry matters have been made the subject of very necessary debate in the EU, which, unfortunately, happens all too rarely.
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.
I also think that keeping a register of cultivated land beyond the experimental stage is unrealistic because I assume that 80-90% of farmland would be entered in such as register in a few years' time.

This is on a local pilgrimage path.


More specifically, the proposal for a directive contains some interesting provisions with regard to clarification.
What we should be doing is educating our own intelligent young people and keeping them in Europe.
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.
It would be constitutionally indelicate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland.

I am glad the Commissioner stressed these.
Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement.

Now the Committee on the Environment has opted for 1 September 2001 and I think that we can agree to this date. It is only a matter of four months.

If we leave it any longer, once we start enlargement we will not be in a position to continue multilingualism.

The information that does exist even shows that things are getting worse.
We must take all the legislative and other measures needed to respect the rights of asylum seekers, by strictly applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention.

And I could give further examples of this kind of thing to justify our abstention.




Mr President, we are talking about the tragedy involving the Russian submarine Kursk and we do of course share all the considerations of this joint resolution on the subject.

- I congratulate my Labour colleague, Simon Murphy, on his recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on tackling late payments in commercial transactions.
This approach also involves - as various speakers have already pointed out - introducing, either under the Europol Convention or under new laws based on the Schengen Convention, clear and transparent principles of democratic and judicial supervision, which will guarantee the fundamental values on which a Union governed by the rule of law must be based.
There the concept of flexibility was adopted for the intergovernmental conference.

It is important that we retain a maximum of 700, with or without the European list.

We are forced to reduce aid to the absolute minimum, and we should have the discussion now.
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process. In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.

Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me, as rapporteur, to say that the debate we have engaged in this morning is the first opportunity since 1993, when the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction was opened, to make a statement on the fundamental issue of changing its regulations.

In Switzerland, on the other hand, where income tax is only 10%, pensions are much higher than in our States.


Indeed, even today, all the newspapers in the European Union were proclaiming that even the fall of the European single currency, the euro, is the fault of the pensioners. Well!
It should also be borne in mind that through regular press conferences and the rapid publication of the transcripts of the questions and answers on the ECB website detailed information about the governing council's reasoning is made available very shortly after the meetings.

Although Member States have made great progress in ensuring the free movement of goods, services and capital, it is clear that we are no nearer to achieving the same for people.

The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.
Seventy per cent of the value of the animal is paid for by the Community, while Member States are required to pay the other 30%, together with the culling costs.
All the previous speakers have said this, and, like you, regretted the fact that short sea shipping suffered from such a poor image in terms of its slowness and inefficiency, even though it provides one solution to traffic congestion, high infrastructure and environmental costs.
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.
I feel sorry for them, not only because of what they are witnesses to, but also because of the volume of material in respect of which they must feel powerless.

I do not want to say that the political parties are the only, or even necessarily, the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society, but they play a part, and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay.





I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I cannot say 'fans' and even the word 'hooligan' is not strong enough for them.
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.





We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive.

pr your missing something it needs to compile
Because, if modern societies have one enemy today, it is irrationality in political behaviour.


Let us compare: last year we had EUR 610 million, and next year will only be able to spend EUR 415 million.

It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.

It is a great disappointment for me that there is such great hatred that it is not possible for Serbs, Roma and other minorities to live in peace in Kosovo although they are under an international protectorate.

mako: dunno.  ISTR him saying something about a week of holiday right after the conf


We have also made clear time and again that we want to protect the Community's social and economic interests and are looking for help in preserving resources.

Rather, we ought to be exercising justice in the sense of sharing the burden fairly, with the rich countries giving in accordance with their abilities.





However, meanwhile, let us forget the annual EUR 200 million from now until the end of the period.




Clearly this agreement is extremely important to the countries of the south; after all, the southern fisheries agreements are directly responsible for 13 000 jobs in Spain and Portugal, among others.
The different aspects mentioned in each report must be taken into account because they make a wonderful contribution to achieving this.
We therefore cannot find any Council document which refers to the exchange of notes between Belgium and the United Kingdom given that, under Community legislation, it is Member States which are responsible for deciding this by mutual agreement and given that this does not require approval by the Council.




martin_: have you run apt-get update since adding it?


Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.
The financial instruments are not being used as they should and the political, economic and social development of those countries is not keeping up with the pace of horizontal cooperation, which is very necessary, nor with the modernity required today by a world which, technologically speaking, is taking giant steps forward.
I therefore propose an interval of two to three years, and I hope you will support this proposal.
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!

That is not to say that the means have to be financial, but we must also look at other policies.
hm... but I still can't get my camera on Ubuntu... hrmf

And yet, as has already been mentioned -and I too should like to reiterate the point - full liberalisation, as carried out by other States in the area of electricity, has produced considerable benefits for the user: need we be reminded of the 25-33% price reduction in the United Kingdom or the almost 35% drop in Germany?

The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.
It should be noted that interest on its own capital is the European Central Bank' s only reliable source of income.

So, allow me to assure you that the Council fully shares Mrs Kinnock's concern with regard to the situation.

Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?
E-money does not mean that money is created.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work and particularly the excellent definition of renewables.












Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mombaur' s report on the state of liberalisation of the energy, electricity and gas markets has the merit of summarising the various Commission communications on the issue.
It is one of the few legacies of colonialism still surviving in the year 2000. Morocco is not complying with the United Nations resolutions.

Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.

Madam President, I voted for the Veltroni report also and above all because, as representative of the Pensioners' Party to the European Parliament, I am aware that pensioners and elderly people spend a lot of time watching television.
I would like to say that it is not advisable at the moment to appeal for frenzied optimism.





I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.
I repeat that this demonstration is a free expression of thought, even though I may not agree with the tone or expressions used.




He has called for an extension of that programme by one year, although Mr Howitt has already pointed out that, in actual fact, we are already halfway through that year.




Indeed the British government is asking for a solution at European level, in a European context.
It is clear that certain areas that have been mentioned have suffered delays in relation to other countries.


The harsh reality is that the billions which are paid to repay debts far exceed the development aid.

The financial envelope envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million.
Only then did we have an opportunity to state our views and to decide whether or not we were going to give our assent to this package of agreements.
I hope that when the Rothley report on the harmonisation of civil liability insurance in respect of the use of motor vehicles is adopted after the third reading on Monday, the Commission can, and will, also incorporate - on account of the harmonised legal basis - the settlement of claims into this future exemption regulation.
The legal text is therefore confirmed.

Mr President, except for photographs and fine words, the Africa Summit has yielded very little.

It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.

Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission if it has changed its opinion in the last twelve hours on the proposed amendments adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture.


Only by rapidly improving living standards, particularly in health, education and employment, will stability remain.


We are delighted by the broad welcome which has been given to the Commission's communication on its assessment and future plans for the Community's humanitarian activities.

Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.
Certain EU countries want to exclude citizens of the future EU countries from the Union' s labour market for a long period.
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start.
Furthermore, Amendment No 14 seeks to restrict the Commission's discretion under the Treaty to decide when to bring infringement proceedings.
2005-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	kergan	yep
Therefore they should form part of national or regional reconstruction and rehabilitation plans.

The EU' s Member States must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy.

Secondly, Parliament made it abundantly clear in its report on the 2001 budget, which was adopted in the Agricultural Committee, that there is extra scope within the framework of the financial agreements of Berlin.



I also think it is important that in all parts of the Union we are able to retain the knowledge that is associated with research patents.

Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.
The amendment seeks to correct this.
Parliament requested a list of current fraud and corruption inquiries; again tick.
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.

It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.

And yet, thanks to the commitment and sense of responsibility of all concerned, we reached a consensus in a difficult, major and highly controversial field, and in doing so we have added another building block in the construction of Europe. At this point in time, in terms of the more general debate currently underway, this is a significant result.

When will we receive it and has the Commission already consulted the automobile distribution sector and particularly the small distributors?



It gets no support from Europe.

Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.

The rules must be applied in the same way to all parties.

Each individual will of course be treated precisely as an individual.



as long as you're just wanting to have another kernel :)

Clearly, nothing is a foregone conclusion and additional efforts, imagination and courage are still vital.



This will be the final stage of the first currency changeover on this scale in the history of our continent.

Mr President-in-Office, I cannot say your answer is satisfactory.

So I should like to stress that this proposal cannot be seen as separate from the other proposals that are already on the table and that they take into account the sensitive question of solidarity among Member States.
In addition to the various initiatives laid down in the MEDA programme - which, I hope, will be given much more funding than the EUR 3 475 million which were appropriated to it between 1995 and 1999 - I hope that measures will also be adopted to keep a check on how European Union funding is used and that a large proportion will go to the peoples of the African countries which border on the Mediterranean, including their elderly citizens.

On a final note, I would just like to say that the Commission will of course assess the reform measures taken.
There is, of course, another danger, and that is that employers, aware of the risk of complaints from unsuccessful ethnic minority candidates, may even avoid putting them on short lists altogether, which would be a terrible disaster and completely against the spirit of the legislation.

Our parliamentarians and Commission officials should go on fact-finding missions to Iraq to meet members of the Iraqi Parliament, EU diplomats, international agencies and NGOs.
ChrisC_, are the other modelines in your XF86Config file?

2005-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	speel	lol 1600X1200?
On the issue of the size and composition of the Commission, there is a consensus that the Commission to emerge from this IGC must be strong, independent and legitimate. Its collegiate nature must be preserved.
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.

As an Austrian, I cannot accept a report which takes exception to my country in a most unqualified and most unjustified manner and which expressly welcomes and supports party-politically motivated action and unjustified boycotting measures by the fourteen.
Land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government, and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections.

The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.
I also believe that Amendment No 9, which seeks to involve civil society in exchanging information and implementing this regulation, is of fundamental importance, because in my opinion the discussions about civil society and the discussions about good governance must not only be reflected on the political soapbox but also in active policy implementation.
ajmitch_: right now this is not intended to replace our default kernel anyway :-)
And we gave an undertaking then that I now want to repeat formally: during all meetings of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, a representative of the Council, at political level, not an official but a political representative of the Council, from one of our 'cabinets' , will always be involved in the work of the committee ...
Every effort must be made in order to ensure that the new negotiations are a success.
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.

But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.

· Selective support for a small group of what are - by Greek standards - medium-sized and large enterprises, with a view to consolidating their satellite role around the monopolies and strengthening the processes used to concentrate capital and production.

Mrs Fontaine accompanied him, which prolonged the essential trialogue that we held with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, by a few minutes.
I personally take the view that we could explore this route a little more, provided it does not lead to further bureaucracy, especially in our host country.
Once again, it seems unlikely that the correct decisions will be taken at the CITES meeting in Nairobi and once again, we will be stepping in to prevent the wrong decisions from being taken.
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.

Is the French Presidency ready and willing to stop acting like Pontius Pilate and to make it unconditionally clear to Turkey, on behalf of the European Union, that, first: Cyprus will become a full member of the European Union, irrespective of whether or not the Cyprus problem is solved first, given that no such solution will be possible due to Turkey's intransigence and, secondly: that Turkey will forever remain a candidate and only a candidate country if it continues to violate the fundamental principles of international law and the European ideal?
We look forward to reading the report with interest, not to say impatience.
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.
ok, how about I add base-config/priority for you now in 2.60ubuntu4
Secondly, the population endures harsh conditions of poverty.
I know there are particular Irish and Finnish interests here, but I do not believe that we can accept peat as a forest-based industry.

Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.


However, at the same time, we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission wishes to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and especially Mr Pirker, for the speed with which the renewed consultation on the Eurodac project has proceeded, as well as for the quality of the proposals that have been presented.

Then at midday on Wednesday, the President of the sitting explained that with the agreement of the groups Mr Seppänen's report would be moved to Thursday morning.
Amendment No 38 is therefore particularly sensible; I endorse it and hope that it will receive wide support, expressly in order to prevent the Mediterranean and Nordic countries from being placed in a position of disadvantage in comparison with the central regions of the European Union, as far as this area of production is concerned.
At the moment we are reconsidering whether or not to go back to Chechnya, as we are needed there.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is for all of these reasons that the Council is taking a special interest in the resolution that this Parliament has just adopted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and will continue to attach the greatest importance to this resolution.

We also have the scope to match, with additional assistance, any further progress made by the DPRK authorities, notably in terms of access to the most vulnerable populations and the improvement of working conditions for non-governmental organisations.

We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.

This was also the case in yesterday' s debate on the Duff and Voggenhuber report and it is also true with regard to the conclusions of the report by Mr Haarder whom I warmly congratulate.
The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers.
These initiatives are intended to combat growing congestion, negative environmental effects, our over-dependence on oil and the high number of road accidents.



With regard to cooperation, the European Union takes the view that it is in the interest of the Tibetan people that we support aid projects in Tibet, provided the group of ethnic Tibetans benefits directly from them and is given priority in the management of the projects.
In the meantime, however, we have good news to impart.
It is because of the risks for the image of hemp that the Commission is proposing a ban on hemp and hempseed being used in food, despite the fact that the varieties which have to be used in Europe do not contain any psychotropic substances.

There is some evidence, although this is not uncontroversial, that a new economy is emerging in the United States.
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.

Subject: Boarding of Community vessels by Canadian inspectors in international waters Five years after the seizure of the Estai, the Community fleet fishing in NAFO international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a Portuguese vessel, the Santa Mafalda, supposedly by Canadian inspectors.






Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?
This gradual liberalisation plan would give us a real common network in the European Union by 2010.

It worries us that there is still government interference in the actions of companies who are seeking appropriate dimensions and competitiveness at a European level.
We are going to have to answer a whole host of employees' questions about local public transport operatives over the next few weeks and months.
If we talk about services within a unified market, this means, of course, that monopolies are then a thing of the past, that we need clear European legislation and that we must move away from monopolies in the service industry. We are all agreed on this, and I therefore hope that we can make good progress.



Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.
It was only after the intervention of the Polish authorities, who, moreover, recognised the validity of the document - and this bodes well for enlargement - that I was allowed to continue my journey.
It is never easy working on comitology.
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.


The European Union has, in this respect, a particular responsibility the tradition addressing this type of problem could almost be said to be part of its civilisation. The EU has an awareness and a responsibility which today' s debate has clearly demonstrated.
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers?

(The President declared the common position approved as amended)

He described himself as a representative of a country notorious for its perpetrators of fascism.
Mr De Clercq says why can we not have five languages.





We have sent a note in this regard, but nothing has been done about it, and so I would ask you now to investigate the matter.

In Finland, we have had such a system for waste oil since 1 June.
I do not think we have time or that it is in fact possible to have an in-depth debate on such a complex problem, but I should like to be able to discuss the matter with the Commissioner outside this Chamber.

Those who deny that and say that we are still in the position of total obstruction, are really admitting - as those are who wish in the vote tomorrow to reject the common position - that they do not want this directive at all.
But we also need clear-cut, comprehensible laws in Europe.
Madam President, as a representative of a Christian political party, I am not an unquestioning defender of Israel' s political interests.
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.

(Applause)I wish you success, and your success will be our common success.


Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also welcomes in principle the Commission proposal, which is in line with the promise made by the Commission to Parliament.
Allow me to mention three important examples of these.

You are relying mainly on further deregulation in the internal market, on the Internet revolution and on e-commerce and e-business to be job machines.
Without relaxing our efforts to control expenditure - of which we have shown signs in the past - we can see that this stabilisation has been the result of an increase in control.
The Commission' s services have worked on a proposal to introduce these tests in BSE monitoring throughout the Community since September last year.
This is of course totally unsatisfactory as far as I and my group are concerned.
In the final analysis, therefore, there was little new money in it.
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.
In my book, new money is money you have not spent already.


What about India and Pakistan, which have substantial resources and large communities resident in Mozambique?
Your objective, Madame Palacio, is to get that world-wide effect.

Mr President, I quite understand that you want to avoid a long debate now, but I do not think it was clear when we decided on this this morning that the urgencieswould simply go by the board.

We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.
Nevertheless, although this is a little repetitive, I would like you to bear in mind and reconsider, with regard to cereals, both moisture content and the monthly price reviews, since they are issues which could cause us considerable harm.


My second point is that we do not believe it is in the remit of the legislative authority to decide whether the laws have been transposed. That is up to the Commission and also the Court of Justice.
However, I am pleased to inform you that consideration is currently being given within the Commission to reorganising our foreign missions, and that this involves a shift of emphasis, so that this point will be taken into account.

Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.


why not having localized ubuntu domains?
I, however, attach less importance to this, given the limited financial resources for foreign policy and the major challenges in other parts of the world.

As to the resources to be implemented in order to ensure maximum synergy between the work carried out in this area by, on the one hand, the United Nations High Commissioner's Office for Human Rights and, on the other, the Council of Europe' s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, but also the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, I would like to remind Baroness Ludford that, on 21 December 1998, the Council adopted a decision relating to the conclusion of an agreement for the purpose of establishing close cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Monitoring Centre, and that the cooperation between these two institutions has actually been very fruitful.

Enlargement will make a complex system of coordination even more complex and it is not surprising that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union takes the free movement of citizens as seriously as it takes its commitment to the free movement of goods.
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.
We need to take immediate action and to regulate the myriad technical details, such as relations between civil and military aviation.
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.
One of the key proposals is to separate the audit and financial control functions.

Sometimes in politics, things are indeed what they seem!
I would like clear information on this matter.

That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.


I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.
The second step is the amendment of the Treaties.

If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.
Resolution 1284 from 1999 provides the opportunity to lift the sanctions, provided the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq.


I will venture brief comments on some issues of interest which, whether or not they form part of an EU initiative, will doubtless be topics of discussion for those attending the 57th Commission.



We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.

The fact is, we received an explanation of the correct procedure, and it is in fact standard practice that we have the questions translated so as to be able to answer them properly and not have to improvise, since this would impair the quality of the answers.

As I can see that the Council is standing firm in its political will, and in order to prevent - as you say - anything like this happening, not through good intentions but through facts, I would like to ask you whether the French Presidency, before it ends, would be willing to make, in the way it considers appropriate, some kind of recommendation which would dispel these concerns, that is to say, which would ensure that Mediterranean production would in no way pay the price for enlargement.
In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work.
In these countries, too, the situation is very alarming.



We need a Community patent in order to stimulate innovation, which is a key factor for growth, competitiveness and job creation in Europe.

Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.
These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority.
As a result, his report was far better than all the previous reports.

We will always continue to defend the right of any citizen of the Basque Country, whether they are in favour of autonomy or of independence, to be able to move around our country without escorts.


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China was yet another of our trading partners to realise during negotiations in Beijing that the European Union has specific, independent weight as a major global trading area.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.
There are various points concerning our relations with other committees.
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.


bob2, now your stuff before you get on peoples case... there have been problems installing mplayer
It means that, for the first time, the international community is being asked to show consistency with its own principles, because the various UN committees agree that these resolutions have been virtually all applied by the Iraqi regime, except for some minor points of interpretation or detail.
We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised.
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.
The Council's bodies are well aware of the type of persecution and mutilation which the honourable Member mentioned in her question.


The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.

The arrangements introduced will clear the way for a list of priority substances to be gradually drawn up every 4 years, that is, priority substances which must be reduced in quantity, and priority hazardous substances, which must purely and simply be eliminated.

I should like to emphasise that there is broad agreement within the Committee on Budgetary Control about postponing the discharge for the most important accounts, and I would thank the rapporteurs for the splendid and painstaking work they have carried out.

We have been well aware of this problem for many years now. Unfortunately, however, we have still not managed to eradicate the disease, nor have we managed to identify all the causes for it, hence all the concerns, restrictions and irregularities in the production and marketing of products of animal origin.
That "the across-the-board return to economic growth means that we can do things today which were impossible yesterday" ?


Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.
Yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect.


We should not be so politically partisan.
In this case it is taking an unnecessary risk to permit the use of chemical substances in toys which affect those that are smallest and most vulnerable in society.




In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.
I think the matter should either go back to the Committee or the Council' s common position, at least its main features, should be adhered to.



On what part of the Treaty, then, is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based?
The next item is the joint debate on the following joint motions for resolutions:
His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal.

Treenaks, are you there ?
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.


calc: thank you!
If there is discrimination between a black person and a white person, or vice versa, for example if someone discriminates against a white Portuguese in favour of a black Portuguese, or against a black Portuguese in favour of a white Portuguese, this is clearly unlawful racism and should result in prosecution.
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.

The deciding factor was the way the Commissioner for budgets handled the Fléchard case.


The Treaty allows Member States to impose limits on the free movement of persons for reasons of public order, public security or public health.


Mr President, I would just like to say a few words on the question of the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties.

B5­0002/2001 by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Council, on the plan to build peace and prosperity and strengthen the State, known as 'Plan Colombia' .
This has always been the case, but today we are formally recording it in a document: on the one hand, we have the Council, which maintains a particular line through the individual States of which it is composed and which makes recommendations on the basis of the decisions of those States and, on the other hand, we have the Community, or, rather, Parliament, which advocates a different, more harmonised, more coordinated and more homogeneous approach.



It is, of course, and I should like to stress this point, prepared to help with the full implementation of the agreements that have been concluded when the time comes.
Time permits only a couple of remarks on my part.
In fact, these reflect our discussions with the WTO complainants and the ACP producers.

Women must be involved in all areas - not just in the defence of their own rights - by participating in the resolution of everyday problems, in the institutions and on company management boards, in unions and in social and cultural organisations.


Personally, for several reasons, I feel that the tone of the report is excessively smug with regard to the liberalisation that has already taken place.
Secondly, research activities have been stepped up, financed by the Community tobacco fund.
The common position is not ambitious enough.
This will require uniform framework conditions.



I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission's proposals and the improvements which, by way of amendment, are contained in María Izquierdo's report.
What is interesting as well as that the chairman, Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments.
wood1: one os file archive with compression, the other only an archive.
The process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old Member States.
daniels: my X laptop gets very unhappy when I start a second X server
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.
I therefore do not understand why we are being accused of racism.

We are faced with a country which apparently fears its own citizens so much that it is willing to violate the most basic human rights and place the unity of the state above the freedom and rights of the individual.
For the future, it is necessary to improve management, increase cooperation with our partners, improve complementarity with the actions carried out through the efforts of Member States and, in short, frame the humanitarian aid actions of the European Union within the global strategy of our cooperation policies.
well
The best way to achieve peace is a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights.

The Member States, the Council and the European Commission must look upon one another as natural partners which support one another and work together constructively to protect citizens and consumers in a manner which engenders confidence.
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.
My view here is that we need additional resources for this.

Some two hundred years on, the right to life has still not been fully recognised in the US legal system and this deserves a strong reaction on our part.
It is criminal to use the weakness of certain individuals to promote a libertarian ideology which spreads distress further afield and ultimately smells of death.


Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union. In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.
Irrespective of which methods we apply, openness is of fundamental importance.
I would like to single out one point from among these questions and requests.

I will take good note of your question.

Let me remind you that this proposal initially provides for consultations between the parties.
Mr President, it is not difficult to express one' s support for the analysis that has been put forward in this report.
I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines.
All G7 countries have promised some form of 100% debt cancellation, but many of them are very slow and disinclined to do it in the way that we would like.
It is all too reminiscent of Austria' s initiative on that famous first day of Austria' s Presidency.

I apoligize in advance for the n00b questions I'm about to ask.  I know unix systems (work in QNX all day long) but need help getting my bearings in my new Ubuntu installation ...

The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.






Each nation should be able to retain the freedom to conduct the foreign policy of its choice, the one most suited to its political and economic interests.


The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial.


Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.
It had never been done before.

We do not have the luxury to harmonise all national measures before putting in place essential health protection measures.
If the conduct of the Greek authorities led to any infringement of Community legislation, the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, would clearly not hesitate to take the necessary steps to bring any action before the Court of Justice in respect of this infringement.
there were fora (?) before there phpBB and the internets
On my own behalf, I will therefore stick my neck out and endorse all paragraphs of the Bösch report which call for the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor' s office. I know it is a controversial issue, even within my own group.
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances.


On the contrary, I feel that it is necessary for Parliament to condemn Russia more emphatically and clearly than before, and that not only the Community institutions, but also the national governments should join us in doing so.

It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union.
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.

We can also entertain very different opinions as to whether we should have common rules within the EU or whether each country should solve this problem on its own.
I would like to turn very briefly to the other reports that we have considered in committee, and first of all to the Kuhne report on the European Parliament.
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.

I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.
This compromise perpetuates the race to open up the markets and introduce competition in rail transport services, for goods and passengers alike, in order to satisfy the economic rationale of profitability, instead of meeting the requirements of the users and employees in this sector.
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against. I will give you an example.
From now on, the United Nations resolutions must be applied in full, Israel must respect its commitments and we must recognise the Palestinians' legitimate right to their own state.

The principle of subsidiarity should come into play here.
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.

This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.


I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.


A further point is to ensure that the directive does not give rise to any protected markets.

Mr Moscovici took the floor yesterday and we will check whether this was included correctly in the Minutes.
The system is quite in accordance with the creation of an area of freedom and justice, and this is something we support.


In that context, let me also say that I fully and wholeheartedly support the amendment Mr Fiori tabled for the plenary.


(The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m.)


Mr President, all of this illustrates the mental and physical chaos of our Community fishing authorities, and it will only be resolved when the guidelines which I referred to earlier are established in a clear and agreed way.




What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:


We must bear in mind, as has already been said by the rapporteur, that the proposal we are considering is before us at our request, at the request of Parliament, because we wanted to get to grips with money-laundering, with this international crime which represents a substantial threat to the single market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, forests play an essential role in preserving the balance of our ecology and are a sustainable resource, albeit in the long term.

I've just tested out the shadow feature of x.org. Looks nice, but the system gets unusable due to too much ressource usage.

I am convinced that these two reports together provide a sound basis for positive developments in Europe in the fields of health and the environment.

The Commission already has this power in the area of agricultural produce, such as grain, sugar, rice and eggs.
It is a pity that the European Union does not have more actions of this kind for other products, instead of dumping them on international markets by means of subsidies which are sometimes twice their price on those markets, which makes it difficult to understand the alleged objective of budgetary savings.


The fourth option is to have two thresholds, one for regions currently within the Union and one for the regions of countries joining the Union.



But how is the family to be defined?



I have a key witness here.


Taken as a whole, the resolution adopted serves to improve transparency and effectiveness, which is to the benefit of Europe' s citizens.
Shame on the sorcerer' s apprentices!

I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.
Yesterday, we were talking about a Charter of Fundamental Rights; today we are speaking of human rights.


Actually, I hear less and less about this.



But it would appear to be difficult to exercise this will when there is the pressure of commercialisation and the pressure, encapsulated in the thoughtless and superficial motto of the Olympic Games, to be 'faster, higher, stronger' .
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.
The result is there is never enough fish and there are increasing numbers of people fighting over the leftovers.

We must also measure the problems due to the air companies or the limited European civil airspace with regard to the number of overflights.

The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.


In addition, we are considering the introduction of a regional cooperation programme which could focus on processing and conservation, quality standards and animal health.
They are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand.
- (FR) I congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her work on the European Commission' s report on the implementation of the European Year Against Racism (1997).
In addition to what the rapporteur has said, we felt it was important that the Commission had incorporated the principle of regionalising the fight against TSE in order to reconcile strict measures and a sense of proportion.


The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.
At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and Mr Provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our Conciliation Committees.

pitti, yes
Sudan must stop supporting the LRA.

We do so primarily because we believe that this key component of the European legal framework for the information society needs to be implemented swiftly.



All too often, the governments of our 15 States think of citizens, particularly pensioners and the elderly, as numbers, people without an identity, a life story or a date of birth.
Despite this, we believe that the entire world, and we, along with the world, must express our dismay and solidarity, now that thousands of people have fallen victim to this earthquake.
I shall end, Mr President, by recalling the words of Jorge Luís Borges when he wrote "Around 500 years before the Christian era, the greatest thing to happen in the history of the world occurred in Greece - the discovery of dialogue.

Quite the opposite, as through them these companies can create a dependency, as that part of this business happens in people' s brains.

I welcome Greece into the euro zone.
If the fisheries industry is to become more competitive, it will depend on the sector' s ability to adapt in order to face up to the constraints imposed by both the state of its resources and by commercial demand.
Riddell, apt-cache search gnome rss


Now transport ministers really do have the opportunity to make a definite U-turn in energy policy in the direction of a sustainable energy economy.


The vote is not the problem, the problem is that you did not receive the motion for a split vote in time.



However, we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is, in fact, race discrimination pure and simple.
However, we do propose a few changes or additions, mainly to be sure that we take account of all possible situations and do not create any unintended holes in the safety net we intend to provide with this initiative.





Repayment of a loan which Germany extracted from the Bank of Greece during the occupation in 1943 also remains outstanding.

I think we would be sending out a positive message if we indicated that we do not wish to maintain the attitude which has dominated for years, allowing the number of additives to grow and grow, even though we know nothing about their synergistic effects in combination.
That is why it is in all our interests to share our experiences.

Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law.

Mr President, I must first thank Mrs McNally for her excellent report.



I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States' budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities.

2 weeks
Parliament and the Commission share the same considerations and agree on the approach.
You are saying that Austria might raise the issue again, but that is not possible in a Council meeting.
Therefore, although there is still a team from the committee still deployed on the ground, we members of the committee as such will not go to the territories until 16 February.

Mr President, as the rapporteur' s fine report points out, the figures recently published by the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, whose headquarters are in Bilbao, indicate very differing results in relation to work accidents between the various Member States, owing to the fact that the States are not applying uniform statistical criteria.
He deserves considerable respect for the very professional and open-minded way in which he has carried out his work.
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.
We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples, for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right: all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire, from the Sahara to Chechnya, from Taiwan to Kurdistan, and, of course, in Tibet.

Amending the MEDA regulation with a view to improving the decision-making process and simplifying the procedure for implementing projects is an important stage in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
I would be in favour of its doing so.

But the Central Bank has no right to publicly present the fight against inflation, which is its obligation under the Treaty, when it itself is free to define inflation as it pleases.
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.
Broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy.
Meanwhile, the countries at the heart of the European Union have been faced with unexpected problems.


These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.


I should like to explain to the honourable Member what my feelings are in this matter, not just the legal aspects.
If anything, these so-called more recent factors deserve more, not less, attention.
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.
For that reason we have asked the lead committee to do two things: firstly, to call on the Commission and Council to outline their intentions and particularly to explain how they intend to divide up responsibilities between themselves in this field and how they intend to finance the relevant activities, and, secondly, to add a recital to the proposed text stating quite clearly that rapid reaction interventions must be financed within Heading 4.
It would be ideal if the decision was taken in Nice to devise a project of this kind in two to three years' time.
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,


The Commission's contribution to debt relief can be seen in the HIPC initiative.



Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.
But the environment is our future and we cannot rely solely on volunteers or fear of a sentence from the Court of Justice to protect it.

In this respect, the Council confirms that it will strictly apply the Treaty when consulting the European Parliament on any action resulting from an initiative of the Member States or the Commission.
Then there is the matter of intermodality across the Alps, where, apart from the Swiss decision to invest heavily in rail transport, there are serious delays in the construction of the other links and the other new rail tunnels already provided for by Community documents, such as those along the Turin-Lyons-Brenner link, or under discussion, such as the Aosta-Martigny tunnel.
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.

Mr President, I have the following question to ask: we have just received the printed version of the texts adopted.




So I must ask this vice-president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported, since it was he who delivered them to us!





But there is some way to go right now.

We would like to have further information, particularly regarding the formation of this authority and we would like to know who would be responsible for monitoring it and by what means they would do so.

It is now our former Austrian companions from the Christian Democratic Union who are in difficulty because of elections in their country.
This was felt to uphold the freedom of contract of the parties but addition there is another element to which I will now turn.

This proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view.

- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to discuss a second aspect of the food safety issue.
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.
The whole thing verges on the ridiculous.

In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to emphasise that the Commission shares the sense of grief caused by the tragedy at Dover, which President Prodi expressed at the Feira Council and as I myself have expressed on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.
This is important to note in view also of the very few statements made during the summit that deviated somewhat from this general consensus about the basic principles that we and others take for granted.
As for the deadline of 13 September set in the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement for concluding Permanent Status negotiations, it cannot be postponed indefinitely unless the negotiations show some tangible sign of progress and the prospect of an early outcome.
It is also a bad sign that no gradual solution has been found to the Kurdish question, the prerequisites for which are much improved today although, Mrs Stenzel, I am unaware of any statement by Ecevit that Kurdish is a Turkish dialect.
There is one word for this solution - protectionism, and there is one instrument for this solution - customs barriers.
We certainly understand the spirit of the rapporteur' s observations on the need to protect national minorities: it sends out a strong message to some of the candidate countries, especially the Eastern European ones, whose nationals do not all enjoy fundamental rights.
We try to frame a single agenda to discuss the impact of what we are doing on other Commissioners' areas of responsibility.

I hope the issue will be on the agenda in our relations with third countries, and I hope the seven countries of the Union which have not yet ratified the statute will do so this year.

We want to ensure maximum flexibility both geographically and bureaucratically, dispensing with complex comitology rules, for example, in favour of straight provision of information to the Council and the European Parliament and simplifying as much as possible the decision-making process.

The next item is the joint debate on:
We maintain that the French-style public service, which is of particular structural value in terms of regional planning and social cohesion, such as postal, railway and energy services, etc., must be defended against the Commission' s position.
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.



For example, to date, only a quarter of the commitment appropriations has been paid out.
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.
We are about to enter the second stage of this joint action.

I take it that the Council and Commission are not applying their own standards of democratic rule of law on a case-by-case basis.

This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.
Secondly, we can all promote policies that develop and encourage literacy and combat the digital divide.
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.
I accept, like Mrs Evans, that this does not, strictly speaking, contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter.

We are, however, convinced that this aid will benefit the population only to a very limited extent, as there are no plans to control the allocation of these sums and consequently, there is nothing to guarantee that they are not, at least partly, misappropriated by the government, or even directly by the wealthy classes.



All this is done in the name of the social function of sport, which produces healthy minds in healthy bodies, to the point that the Treaty of Amsterdam now includes a declaration on sport emphasising "its role in forging identity and bringing people together" .
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.
Mr President, let me repeat what I said yesterday, namely that the French Socialists will not take part in the vote because they believe that this is not the correct procedure, since the only environmental directives referred to are those on wild birds and on Natura 2000 and a more balanced approach should have been taken.


We have to be better at assessing the results of compliance with environmental legislation.

srbaker, hang on i give you apt line




Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.

Clearly, ICT has a flat structure, and that is to women' s advantage.
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.

I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.

okay thanks

In that resolution we called on the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the Iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering.
it's an idea

We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.


The reality of Sellafield goes beyond the contribution to the Kyoto targets on the dependence of the UK economy on nuclear energy.
However, beyond that, they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the Member States and from associated countries.





The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.
For the north-south high-speed link from Berlin to Verona, only a few minor components have been constructed.


Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.
Now, I feel that the issue here is not which devices should be used in aircraft to reduce noise, for standardised procedures exist to control the levels of aircraft noise, but that the important thing is for the noise limits not to be exceeded.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.


This means that the 2001 budget will make it possible to set clear goals within education and health care.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, on a splendid and successful piece of work.
I arrived in the Basque Country keen to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I am convinced that some day the Basque Country will achieve the peace it desires. To those who believe that there is conflict in the Basque Country, I would say that the only conflict in the Basque Country goes by the name of ETA and must be eliminated.

It is just as pertinent to emphasise the importance of good administration for the public and for the authority of the EU in the eyes of our citizens.


It will therefore make it possible to support actions within the Member States such as improving reception conditions and procedures in terms of infrastructures and services (accommodation, material assistance, social welfare, assistance with administrative procedures), the integration of persons entitled to some form of stable international protection, voluntary repatriation and reintegration into the country of origin.
We will clarify this matter, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.
5. Increases the relevant authorities' powers of intervention in case of non-compliance with limit values at installations.
if people need space for that they can talk to me

Mr President, it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all.
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.
what happened to apt in hoary?  I keep getting "unknown error executing gpgv" when I do an apt-get update  Anyone have an idea how to rectify this?
As regards the scope of this security policy, there is deliberate ambiguity.

Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters.
Mr President, allow me to start with a few comments on the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 2 May on the rights and duties of the members of this House vis-à-vis OLAF.
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.



I am thinking of one very worthy project within my own constituency which, because of the very short timetable and a misunderstanding, did not enable contracts to be drawn up by the end of December last year.


And I was there again a couple of weeks ago and can testify to the enormous change for the better which has occurred thanks to NATO' s intervention.
It is up to Sweden to initiate the phase which President Prodi calls 'open reflection' .



These three languages are clearly French, German and English. In this way, respect for the identities, nations and cultures of Europe and cost-effectiveness in the daily work of the European institutions could be combined.

There appear to be a number of gaps in this area.

We must have real EU embassies that are at least some sort of a match for the United States embassies, especially in areas where it is the European Union that bears most responsibility.
I very much welcome Parliament' s backing on this and I hope that the Council will also react positively.
In contrast to a committee of inquiry, which in this case would serve no purpose, this would be a constructive initiative.
The fact that we called all our heads of delegation to Brussels at this time is a sign of our determination to give a firm lead to the external service and to provide it with the career structure and the leadership that it deserves and needs.
Social inequality, violent traditions and the lack of state power give guerrilla fighters and paramilitary units free reign to sustain their unscrupulous acts of terror.
The Commission will therefore consider how due account can be taken of these concerns while ensuring political, legal and administrative consistency.
He wants to break this monopoly as quickly and radically as possible.
We would also have been more reassured if the resolution had included our concerns about the methodology which is being used to assess the risks of depleted uranium.
Surely the hatred for Jews which remains significant in many countries is due as much to anti-Semitism, and therefore to ethnic origin, as to religious aspects.
I was incensed when, as late as yesterday, the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in 'category'.
During committee discussions, we took a more lenient approach but, ultimately, decided to start the negotiations with this figure.
Not only is Wednesday' s agenda completely overbooked, but important reports - such as the Sjöstedt report on natural habitats, as well as others - are being handled without debate, which is wrong to my mind.


Hence the main deadlines during our presidency will be as follows:
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.



I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.




The perpetrator here is, of course, the Turkish regime which, a priori, sees every left-winger, every Communist and every Kurd as a terrorist, whom it then tries to eliminate.



As we go from directives to amendments, however, these six products become seven, eight, nine, up to and including soya, oilseed rape and GMOs.
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.



Those rules are far too complicated anyway.
This ambition is reinforced by the desire to make a useful contribution to the preparations for the UN' s special session on children in September 2001.
Specific rules will also have to be laid down covering the criteria and organisational provisions for the allocation of these funds and for activating the respective monitoring mechanisms.

In 1998 the International Atomic Energy Agency declared that Iraq no longer had a nuclear capacity.
Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole.
We want to know about issues where Member Governments have blocked transactions.
We were assured, I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary, who has now become the First Secretary, that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion.

Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?
Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then, thanks to the speaking time for my group, I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate.
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
If they are included at all, this is done so in a completely chaotic format.

ok i'll try.


It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.

We are, of course, aware that those funds which do exist are strictly budgeted for and that it is difficult to move funds around within the budget.
The clear conclusion is that the most important role of delegations is the administration of external assistance, not to try and run some additional diplomatic tasks.
I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this.



We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate.
Yesterday, there was a question from Mr MacCormick on the postponement of the vote on the COM for bananas.

Little more than a year ago, when I first came into contact with this House as future Commissioner with responsibility for energy, I indicated very clearly that, from the Commission' s point of view, there were two crucial elements which needed to be considered in the coming years.

During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.



This is a purely ideological measure, with no direct effect on the environment.

It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.

We are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective.

Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.


tuggy1: nicotine is great for music
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.
I am convinced that, with regard to the consumer, we would be taken more seriously by producers if we were also to do away with the slaughter of animals at risk and if we were to have the same legislation throughout the entire Community.


The ALTENER programme is enabling magnificent work to take place and Parliament has always been an ally of the Commission. It has always cooperated with the efforts of the Commission and, I repeat, has even been a driving force in making the Commission' s proposals more ambitious.

Mr President, the discussion on labelling beef has reached a point at which it is crucial to restore confidence among producers and consumers.
The consequences in this matter are that Austrian candidates are not being supported in international organisations, Austrian ambassadors are not being received at a level above director-general and there is a freeze on political visits. These are the famous 'sanctions' .
However, over and above our common goal, we feel that certain elements of the Council's proposal deserve careful consideration.
yes i did bob2


Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.


It was reported in the news this morning that the euro has already fallen below the psychological limit of 90 cents, which augurs even more worrying and serious falls in value.
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.
I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market.
This surfeit of aircraft inevitably goes hand in hand with delays in air traffic, causing frustration for passengers, for companies, for business and for tourism.
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.
We must also remember that applicant countries, i.e. the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, should be involved in this fraud prevention process for the very reason that such a large share of the Community budget is administered within the Member States.


But we also want to help them out of emergencies so that they can stand on their own feet again as quickly as possible.

We will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now.
Mr President, the discussion on the rapid reaction facility is starting to drag.
It is not always the case - and we are aware of this too - that the interests of local people are respected; instead they are often subordinated and sacrificed to the economic interests of particular groups, such as for example multinational logging companies.
You are satisfied on many points, but not always 100%.


Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.

But in my view this is precisely what is urgently required to prevent tragedies such as the one in Dover from being repeated.
If it is appropriate to use any more sophisticated technology that might make counterfeiting and piracy more expensive and more difficult to engage in, then the fight we undertake should not neglect to use radical means, applicable immediately. Failing to do so would mean that our policies, however well intentioned, will be forever missing the boat.


Finally, the development of action plans is on the 'scoreboard' .

We are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme.
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.
I should like to point out, in that connection, that, a few weeks ago, 80 000 young people from the countries of the European Union took part in a competition to find a motto for Europe, and the one which was adopted in the end by the grand jury was "Unity in diversity" .





Mr President, on the basis of the information provided I shall wholeheartedly recommend this report.
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.


I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.




That is also a factor in making the process in Europe more costly and slower than that of our competitors.




So it may be unfortunate that some people who have chosen particular political parties get labelled in that way but it is their own ultimate responsibility.
This relates to the period from 2000 to 2003 and includes preventive measures to fight violence against children, young people and women and allows funds to be provided to governmental and non-governmental organisations active in this area.
Some countries of the European Union allow pilots to continue flying up until the age of 65, but in other countries they have to stop working at 60.
Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country.


We must all realise that the European Union has a set of policies which it aims to implement and that these policies involve strategic choices.
To take full advantage of the diversity of our instruments and funding mechanisms, we must make sure that we have a framework in which we can formulate the necessary horizontal guidelines and priorities in order to ensure effectiveness and consistency in what we do.

Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.
A Commission document has just shown that half of the young people who pursue postgraduate studies in the United States go on to stay there.
I hope that you and your colleagues will be vigilant in ensuring that we have the opportunity to maintain that diversity, as it adds to what essentially the core of Europe is all about.

We are now looking at what we can do during the summer, now the winter emergency is over, to build on it.

How will it monitor their involvement more effectively?



We should support each country' s sustainable development plans.
Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments, I have no problems with the underlying message, which it is worth conveying, and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed, and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products.

This is in no way a uniquely western way of thinking; these values are at the root of a shared democratic consciousness.
I think this accusation is completely uncalled for, however much I, along with certain others, would have been only too pleased to see Italy win.
If we nonetheless choose to vote in favour of the whole report, that is because we believe that fundamental human rights are one of the foundations upon which the EU is built and because we want a Charter concerning these to be drawn up in the form of a political document.
I should like to say this in conclusion.
I trust now that the Member States will comply with the wishes of Parliament and the Commission in this matter to ensure that the effective targeting of structural funds at the poorest regions is not undermined.
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.
We really do have to invest in research into energy sources.
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.


Even if these very young girls seem willing, because they are being threatened or are in love, we cannot, at any price, allow prostitution to continue freely when you see how these women are terrorised and traded.

So what has become of these famous practical proposals?



lsusb(1) reports all usb devices
Firstly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for taking up all our proposals in the debate.

I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .

Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?

In any event, of the relevant amendments, the Commission accepts the spirit of Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 17, but with a different wording.
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.
Your fellow Members who are giving their explanations of vote?
The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment.
ogra: i'm quite new to all this ubuntu stuff :) .. but why aren't they like upgrading the packages and stuff? in debian they did it all the time.. and for about 2 months ago they did it with ubuntu too, i think..


Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.


The Commission must therefore have genuine powers for making proposals, and not only for recommendation, and Parliament must participate seriously, starting with consultation, but extending to codecision.
This has already happened in the case of road transport. The European Parliament has made its position clear but it appears that the Council is unable to adopt the common position.
I have to say that I was surprised by the Council's rejection of the Commission proposal for the safeguard clause and by the introduction of a committee procedure that will not guarantee that a prompt decision is taken in the event of a serious risk to human or animal health.

It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.
which means offer people the use fo the official artwork and css if they want, but also let them to anything else if they think it suits their community better

Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.
We shall carry on with our debate.
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.
But what is vital is that the people across Europe have a debate about the future, a debate about political union.


The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.
This rule ought to be changed so that an additive can only be put on the positive list if there is a clearly documented technological need for it which is also, mind you, of benefit to consumers.


We hear a lot about environmental impact, and that is fine.





Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?
I am not getting at you.

Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.

With regard to coordination, it urges the Commission and the Member States to coordinate Structural Fund policy more closely with the Cohesion Fund, the other regional development instruments and the various European Union financial instruments such as trans-European networks and the EDSP.
Madam President, I wonder whether history is repeating itself in Indonesia.

And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.
This is what we must fight, and we must also, where necessary, combat the spineless consensus between traditional political parties, on the left wing as well as the right, which helps gain them more sympathisers.

We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.
That is why the Commission decided that family reunification should be given priority treatment over other forms of lawful immigration.

To this end we propose various mechanisms and, amongst other things, we envisage the possibility of joining together the missions of those Member States that agree to do so with the current Commission delegations, at the appropriate time.

Freedom of the press for Russia is also a service to the Russian people.

If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.

The European Commission does not provide for any "geographical limitation" to the Rapid Reaction Facility (RRF).
I shall conclude by adding that sport must be brought within the scope of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
First of all we were enormously grateful to the delegation from Parliament that went recently to Kosovo and was able to confirm that our team there is doing a good job and that there is not an absorption capacity problem as far as the assistance is concerned.
In short, today we are quite rightly acting as the plaintiff, but we need to be very aware of the fact that, tomorrow, we will be in the dock ourselves.
:)

That was the meaning of my question; I do not think we should just stand around and wait because it may be too late by then and an agreement may not be so easy to reach.
I would very much like to support this report.
Commissioner, I hope that, in preparing the future directive on the single sky, the Commission will be able to handle this matter by taking a calmer and more impartial overall view.

I hope this question was not an improper one at this time.
Mr President, the European Union lacks moral authority.

According to the external evaluation it has been subjected to, the ECIP has demonstrated a significant multiplier effect, creating jobs and joint ventures.

At the same time, it would mean that in no European country could those in power dare, in the name of sovereignty or the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, to systematically stifle or limit either individual or collective human rights.


In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.

One of the main problems was the question of retention of title, whereby the vendor retains ownership of the goods pending full payment.
I hope that members of the European Parliament will form part of the team.
In this case they have basically done what they want.

The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.

We hope that you have success with your contact with the Parliamentary group on the important issue of the Statute of Members.
One sees references, albeit only in chapter headings, to the Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic policies and sustainable growth.


This is highly reminiscent of the exploitation of agricultural workers in some countries who are forced to buy from the boss' s shop at inflated prices and who are then forced to work for the rest of their lives for scant wages in order to pay off their debts to this shop.





I would also like to point out - although I was unable to participate in the Conference of Presidents in person, owing to our European People' s Party Congress, my colleague, James Provan, was there to represent me - that the issue has already been voted on in the Conference of Presidents and so there is no need for it to be raised once again.
There are other typing mistakes: the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have the same size population as Belgium and Portugal, are only to have 20 MEPs, while the other two countries have 22.
As underlined by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Guterres, we were able to coordinate our economic policies to launch the euro.

(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)
So, Mr President, I shall speak as slowly as appropriate, because I believe that you do not intend to disallow a genuine debate that includes a full presentation of each argument.

We think this is a more serious solution to the problems of the third world than the outrageous recommendation which the UN made on 4 January to the effect that, in order to offset its falling birth rate, Europe should prepare to accept 159 million immigrants from African countries over the next 25 years.
hm





Ill-treated, ragged children are often to be seen on the streets, and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passers-by and to induce them to give them some money.

I myself advised against the amendment, because we are not out to score any additional points in this discharge, but if the Commission could confirm this, we could then all vote against the amendment with a clear conscience.
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.
jblack: I need to reboot production and devel supermirror - ok?
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.
Other solutions would probably have a less favourable effect on environmental protection, and my group can assent to this report on that basis.


you are talking about windows AND a lot of software installed after installation


no
Aircraft noise is not determined by engine by-pass ratio alone, and I believe that aircraft noise should be measured by the actual noise made during take-off, fly-past and landing as is the case under the Chicago Convention.
More needs to be done, particularly in terms of reducing the administrative burden and establishing ways of projecting the public profile of the service.
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Tyche	I'm going to download and do some testing on these CMS. Are any of them in warty?


You use the same instructions as people with brand new cards.
Why should it not be applied to aluminium factories, hospitals, ski runs, hypermarkets, parliament buildings and high-voltage networks too?






I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.

The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the famine in Ethiopia.


I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 15 December 2000.
We cannot even find a statistical table of the numbers of refugees currently residing in the various countries of Europe.
In particular, the question of the hidden debt must be raised urgently - and in this regard the Central Bank could and should make a far greater contribution than it does at the moment. This debt arises from the public pension systems in many countries, particularly but not exclusively in Italy.
Mr President, building Europe means first and foremost being aware of its diversity and its differences.

This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning.
In certain respects the directive forms a framework whose contents are still unclear.
Also, on some routes, fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I had to hurry when I noticed my electronic gadgetry up there in my office on the twelfth floor was telling me the list of speakers was being worked through at a rate of knots.
I would also like to comment on point 10, the contents of which I think involve an unfortunate development in the direction of militarisation of the European Union.
But we have not solved the problem.

There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.

It is therefore important always to keep both perspectives in view.
Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people' s lives apart.

Other models will be published in the near future.
The objective of improving competition and lowering prices for all consumer groups, including the end consumer, must be pursued assiduously.
In fact, it appears that France comes bottom of the class as far as this matter is concerned.

We have already discussed them at length.




We have a unified market, free movement of people and a single currency.

Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.
I agree that there will be centres of power and organised powers which will try to reverse all this progress and review the agenda which we have agreed on.
The question has been put to you.
Let us remember that this is the first text in the process of integrating the 'justice and internal affairs' pillar into community policy in the wake of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council last November.

Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.

Subject: Transport of water from France to Spain and the sustainable management of water resources France is understood to be intending to launch an aqueduct scheme for transporting water from the Rhône to Barcelona, with the participation of the Lyonnaise water company.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.
I was in Rotterdam myself, in the spirit of complete impartiality necessitated by my position as President of the European Parliament, and I can confirm that the atmosphere was indeed as you describe.

Secondly, this is a report according to Article 37. We reserve the right - I will discuss this with the other groups - to refer this back to committee, because what you have said, your assumptions that is, will of course put paid to the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

Where the reforms and the Intergovernmental Conference are concerned, we are disappointed, however.
tim1, I'll just wait for some fixage :)
i was only doing a test compilation
?
If I am not mistaken, as I said in my question, the Commission expressed a favourable opinion.


In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?

As I already stated, I would particularly like to thank Mr Wieland, but also other Members who have worked with him, for all the sound work they have done in order to reach this agreement.

But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.




Mr President, the majority of my group considers that, unfortunately, the unambitious and technical nature of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report means that it fails to live up to its fine title of a common Community diplomacy.
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.
She said that Europeans are quite "scandalised by untrammelled capitalism, whose relocations, social dumping, ruthless exploitation ... and remorseless pursuit of profit at the expense of working men and women have a direct and traumatic effect on their lives."
We know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable.
In particular, the diversity of Europe' s gastronomy and food customs is part of its heritage and culture, if only at the cost of local specialities foreign to the internal market.




First, the question about Parliament's assent.



Literally all the subjects we have touched on this morning - the need for a major operation to coordinate the budget, the need for a joint action and the need to adopt a position on the Intergovernmental Conference and on relations with the Council - all require Parliament and the Commission to work together.
The Union never misses an opportunity to reiterate the importance of international legitimacy, its concern to see the United Nations resolutions applied, the basic principles which inform the peace process and its determination to encourage the parties to continue with the peace process through close, regular political dialogue with all the parties in the region.






Young farmers need greater access to production rights.

If, in future, we could manage to prevent repeat offenders from attending other events, and if, finally, as Mr Fodé Sylla indicated earlier, we were able to monitor a subject such as that in order to develop new teaching on behaviour in stadiums, then sport, and not political concern, would win through.

Subject: Jailing of opposition politician Xu Wenli in China Is the Commission aware of the recent trial involving Xu Wenli in China and the severe prison sentence that was imposed.
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.
On behalf of the 31 delegates, I would also like to thank the Commission which immediately expressed sympathy in the form of a letter from Mr Prodi to the municipality of Enschede.


This accession partnership will define the priority areas for reform on which the European Union considers that Turkey must concentrate its efforts in order to comply, hopefully in a progressive, capable and complete manner, with the Copenhagen criteria.
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked: why are we so keen on short sea shipping at European level?





lostmonk: as long as you're interested, it will come soon


With regard in particular to the aspect which is of great concern to my country - the regulation on combating fires - it is regrettable that whereas in the period 1992-1996 the European Union benefited from an annual sum of EUR 14 million, this annual sum is now to be reduced to EUR 10 million, that is, by 40%.
This is first and foremost this Criminal Court.
The meeting of chancellors of the Organisation of American States in Ottawa, having heard the report of the electoral mission headed by Eduardo Stein, has decided to send a new mission, which will include the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States, in order to ensure that the Government of Peru is adopting the necessary measures to re-establish democratic legality.


I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.

We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.

Ambiguities and inadequacies are, however, just as evident in the proposal before us.
Mrs Schreyer, Members of the Commission, use the postponement of discharge for the 1998 budget as an opportunity to show that the new team is strong on management and able to act.

We want the Central Bank to play its full part on the international scene and to make an active contribution to defining new rules that will enable the international financial system to operate without crises.


Apologise to the people spied on, for all that evangelism?
However, surely these institutional requirements include safeguarding the credibility of the European Union.

It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds.

Does the Commission think it possible that some kind of strategy could be found regarding these built-up areas?





Turning to the question about financing our policy in Kosovo through the agricultural budget, I must make it absolutely clear that the United Nations mission in Kosovo cannot possibly be financed from agricultural budget headings, since there is no appropriate legal basis for this.

In 2001, the derogation for the liberalisation of various sectors will lapse, at which point the large hidden government debt - half the size of the current one - will become public.
When we forgive debt, we have used the money.

In fact, Member States are directly affected by this policy.


To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.
Thirdly, we should not have cooperation or integration of a variable composition, since that would mean a Europe á la carte, that is to say, an ungovernable Europe.




Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.
Furthermore, as we saw in Seattle, the new round of WTO negotiations should be a genuine development round.

Thus, direct economic intervention should be used: it should be remembered that many breeders have thousands of head of cattle and they don't know what to do faced with the reduction in demand for their product.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Algeria, the month of Ramadan has been marked by a new escalation in the terror: after all the dreadful massacres which have taken place since 1991, at the start of the civil war, not to mention the thousands of people traumatised or missing, and the anguish and terror of their families.


We shall, and must, be able to devote all our energies to these two areas.


An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts. What should we do with the shredded products?

I have agreed with Mrs Flesch that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through unchallenged, as there are a number of useful contributions there.
It is also not interested in the damage to the environment and to the safety and working conditions of employees caused by the race for maximum profits.
like, when people are meeting up, and where

Europe' s seas are becoming cleaner, which will benefit the flora and fauna, and not least, the fishing industry.


In this area, the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management.


The financial framework is limited and EU payments must be in proportion to the benefits granted in return.
The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough, Commissioner, especially given the Russian situation.
This report proposes changes. Changes always meet resistance in institutions and we should therefore be especially grateful that the rapporteur has wished to draw up this report with the support of the PPE, and, we hope, of the other political groups in Parliament.


Mismanagement of the crisis, particularly the poor coordination between the various authorities involved, became apparent and was noted in the course of the Commission inspection.
It might be useful, in this context, to highlight the outcome of the negotiations because, at the end of the day, we made a certain investment, and we must assess this investment jointly in order to be able subsequently to decide in this House whether or not we can go along with it.
According to the terms of Chapter I of Title 11 of the Treaty, in particular, I am thinking specifically of problems to do with working conditions and improving the working environment.
We are in favour of the report focusing upon the breeding grounds for racism and xenophobia in Europe.

I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.

The analysis of road accidents is decisive.

Peace is a dangerous word if the European Union is required to use it but is not able to follow it up with action.




anir: you may have "standardization" in mind. i agree that standardization in the way of windows and mac os x is important and good. but you won't find many fans of that among unix people.
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.
I appreciate the support from Parliament to that effect.
amathis, ok, was thinking nmap, use xsane
But is there not more to it than that?
I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective prayer.


We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.
An initiative of this kind is a first step towards crime prevention.
Control without referring back to errors detected previously is a job half-done.


First of all, I was surprised to hear you criticise what you called 'a shift towards an intergovernmental approach' , because, if one thing has occurred in the six months of the Portuguese Presidency, it is that the Council has actually become stronger at the expense of the Commission and Parliament. This was also clear from your words when you described the Employment Summit as 'showing a strong desire for political leadership of the Union' , demonstrating that, in fact, you see this as leadership by the Council at the expense of the other two institutions.




Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy deplores the fact that the action plan for the financial markets does not take into account the problems which industry, small and medium-sized businesses in particular, is facing with regard to financing cross-border activities.
It is only by joint across-the-board action that we can tackle this issue, not least by agreeing to extra-territorial application of criminal laws.

Question No 48 will be replied to in writing.


As far as the scope of the directive is concerned, I am pleased to say that, thanks to good mutual cooperation, we have reached an acceptable wording.
Provision for administrative details, evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the Commission in the Implementing Regulation.

Mr President, we have a problem: we are not moving with events.


It was however initially scheduled, I thought, for noon tomorrow.
Nor do we support the constitutional process of which the adoption of a Charter is an integral part.


They have also revealed how slow the Commission' s and the Court of Justice' s reactions are when it comes to inadequate implementation.
good ol' ctrl-alt-backspace, slay pozac routine
To their growing dismay, these fervent defenders of the political status-quo within the Islamic Republic have been pushed onto the defensive since President Khatami took office in 1998.
Within the Council of Ministers, the only item which survived in the framework decision was that of criminalisation, and all Denmark' s other ideas have been taken out.

Therefore, the only way that there can be a social scheme capable of being incorporated into the business world and the Western world is through education.
I am not an opponent of school milk as such but I do object to the way we are going about it.
It seems to me to be a good thing that this debate has got under way and I would like to extend warm thanks to the Members who supported me in this.
(SV) If Amendment 6 to Article 2 of the directive is adopted, the following explanation of vote from Parliament's Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats will apply.


We must implement the Treaty of Amsterdam by the end of 2004.
Despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise, we must accept that there have been positive results.




The Commission is financing with EDF regional funds the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism, which could provide an appropriate channel for dialogue on this question.

The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].

Thanks to this manipulation of the accounts, to this 'creative accounting' , the deficit criteria for joining the first phase of economic and monetary union were complied with.






It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.








Not only does Sweden give up its policies of non-alignment and independence, but it is now also going to work actively towards implementing the militarisation of the EU.

The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.

We therefore hope to have reason to vote for this report tomorrow. We will if this House approves a set of just six or seven amendments which we feel are essential to ensure that this issue is considered not from a position of national egoism but from one which defends the coherence and solidarity of the European project.
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.




I am bringing up these subjects because I believe we must not cease to remind the countries of the Mediterranean of their responsibilities as regards the rule of law and human rights.

In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.

This conflict of words paints us into a political corner.
Here we come to the crux of another issue that will be extremely important for life in our societies in the coming decades: our ability to live together with different people, to promote tolerance in our societies and to combat xenophobia and racism in their various forms.

There is an obvious need for a collective conscience which will take care of the whole world and not just our own particular interests.



If we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far.
It is true that we must move forward in the area of the common foreign and security policy and support our currency politically as well, but progress has to be made in the defence of the fundamental values of our Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must reflect this.


This implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems.
- The proposal for this directive deals with situations in which a traffic accident occurs in the country of residence of the person causing the accident or in a third country.
Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible.


This question will then, at all events, return to Parliament.
Are some still saying that they will put this material into landfill?

We obviously support a global approach including support for democratisation and promotion of the rule of law, support for the prevention of conflicts and for reconciliation, respect for human rights and the development within countries and regions of origin and of transit of the fight against poverty, by improving living conditions and by creating greater opportunities for employment.

prity much
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.


As the Commission has said, the consequences of Mitch will considerably reduce the results of the efforts towards economic recovery and investment made there during the last decade by the European Union.

I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.
Mr Newton Dunn, I am afraid to say that this is not an original idea.


Report (A5/0053/2000) by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the communication from the Commission "Towards a single market for supplementary pensions - results of the consultations on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market" [COM(1999) 134 - C5-0135/1999 - 1999/2131(COS)]

The directive should be adopted by unanimity no later than 31 December 2002.
I am glad the European Parliament and the Council have agreed to make 2001 the European Year of Languages.
I, too, see the nature of these issues as very specific and share the view stressed by my fellow Members that they are sensitive.


We shall now proceed to the vote.
The Commission must not stand idly by in a situation of this kind.
I put two questions to colleagues. First, do we need this observatory at all?

However, after the failure of the single land policy, known as the CAP, the single sea policy, known as the CFP, we can now look forward to a similar failure of the single sky policy.
But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement.
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.

In the meantime, as you will remember, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation last September on the basis of the Kinnock report, whose trade component was implemented in January of this year.



The atmosphere on that occasion was serious and results-oriented, and both parties declared themselves optimistic about the opportunities for achieving a final settlement.




Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?
Young people, judges, the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend.
I would not dare to say so, because I have no proof at all.
Although SMEs now employ two-thirds of the workforce in the whole of the European Union, there is still employment potential in the SME sector.


It must not be allowed to carry on picking and choosing the European policies it wishes to implement.
The Belder report also states this unequivocally.
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);
How far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration!

The Group of the Party of European Socialists is all for imposing European rules on the aviation industry and making it pay for the environmental pollution which it causes.
I hope that we shall see other such historic moments when other countries join and, even more so, when we proceed, as we must, with the policy to complete unification.
smurfix: true..
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.

There is currently a ban on exporting hazardous waste, including to third countries, that is to say non-EU countries.
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.
The first would like to see a thorough re-evaluation of the entire system and all the foundations, past and present, of the common fisheries policy. The second, while avoiding a complete re-examination of the existing foundations, would like to see the system clarified, amended and improved so that the fisheries sector can develop while, of course, preserving fish resources.
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?
In my opinion, one of the major mistakes of the past, in our information policy, was the fact that this was often top-down information identified, wrongly, I must say, as propaganda.
My second point concerns energy. The Commission has concluded that a coherent European energy policy has been lacking in the past.
Clearly, in any pan-national single market, measures cannot be confined to a single Member State' s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties, criminal law and procedures.








We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes. The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.
Europe is democratically bankrupt. The operation of the institutions is quite outside the concerns and outside the control of the citizens.
In the areas for which I have some responsibility, there were also, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, some important developments at Feira.
The first is the replacement of the word 'review' by the word 'examination' as the English translation of the German Überprüfung; this is only a linguistic adjustment.
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin, as some previous speakers have done, by thanking Mr Savary - the author of these two reports - for his work on achieving harmonisation, which has been difficult, but which has looked to the future. His task has certainly been difficult, and this has been demonstrated by the conflicting interests expressed during tonight' s speeches.




Situation in Turkish prisons - B5-0059/2001 by Mr Duff, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Turkish prisons;

I therefore fully support the motion for a resolution before us and oppose the amendment.

I know that it has a Prism2 chip.
North Korea is finding it difficult to make good those few, largely symbolic commitments it made in the military field, it is delaying the reunification of families who were separated by the war and have remained so for 50 years and it is showing no sign of intending to make the return visit of Kim Jong Il to Seoul, planned for spring this year, a practical reality, and it is not yet known when or whether this will take place.


The recommendations from this meeting will be presented at ASEM' s meeting of Foreign Ministers in Beijing in May of this year.
The Council has on a number of occasions expressed its concern in statements and initiatives and in the EU's Common Position of 1996.
What is the point of the European Parliament?

Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the proposal for a Council Regulation on the European Community fisheries agreements with Mauritius and the Republic of Guinea.
ogra: ahh, danke
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.
It is strange that neither Switzerland nor any of the EEA countries are among them, although they would be the best suited of all to join.




To what extent has it implemented Article 87(2) of the Treaty, which allows it to grant exemptions?
Only national reconciliation can offer some hope and this is certainly true of Burundi.
Madam President, I very much hope that Mr Staes will get well soon, but I believe that we should also remind and ask the media to inform our co-citizens that our life is not a bed of roses, and that coming and going like nomads is not the best thing for our health.


In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.
garcia79, ifup eth0 perhaps?
anir, what error do you have?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would just like to add my own deepest sympathy with regard to the victim of the attack which occurred in Catalonia this morning, and also to stress my concern at the events in London.
I must ask you to intervene once again, and I also call upon the Commission to intervene, to ensure that human rights are fully observed in the course of this trial, so that thirteen people are not condemned to death for reasons unknown, given that this Parliament has repeatedly declared its opposition to the death penalty.


Let me explain now what we are actually proposing here.
While water, electricity, telephone and supermarket bills are also shown in euros, I regard that as a mathematical exercise of limited usefulness.
The appropriate setting for achieving international legal harmonisation and solid advances in the international protection of human rights is the agreements and conventions ratified by the Member States in as wide a geographical area as possible.

Mr President, as reflected in the resolution agreed between the four groups, we have had good news and bad news with regard to Paraguay.

Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.
A renewed arms race at local and regional level, along with an increase in military budgets will mean a remilitarisation of the world.
I have listened to the French Presidency' s answer with a great deal of interest.
We will therefore conclude questions to the Council and thank him for being here.

Furthermore, obviously we do not propose to join in the ode to 'effective competition' contained in this resolution.

. (PT) We are voting against the joint motion for a resolution that has been tabled because we cannot accept that we are still trying to deny the obvious, i.e. the serious effects on the health of people in areas affected by the use of weapons containing depleted uranium.
We, for our part, certainly are not.
- (FR) Our abstention from the vote on the Charter certainly does not mean we are opposed to its European character.
Without making a value judgement, I think that both countries, India and Pakistan, must exercise extreme restraint.


I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.




cool :)


Despite reducing the quantity of catches in the agreement with Guinea, the economic compensation to be received by the African country will be maintained, since the new protocol increases the amount of the tariffs and the licences which must be paid by Community shipowners.

It is especially worth highlighting the need to give the citizens of third countries resident in the European Union political rights, by granting them the right to vote in local and European elections.
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.
This will also be the key point of discussion for the foreseeable future.

The situation is this: you tabled a text which no longer complies with the standard procedure agreed with the Council.
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.

We must also recognise that the waves of immigrants towards the countries of the European Union have been more or less constant for a couple of decades.

Proposal for a Council decision modifying Decision 1999/311/EC of 29 April 1999 adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (TEMPUS III) (2000-2006) (COM(2000)0184 - C5-0231/2000 - 2000/0074(CNS)) (Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport)
It has signed all kinds of international Treaties, including those protecting human rights, banishing torture, etc. Nevertheless, Turkey continues to bomb the Kurds who live outside its borders, in northern Iraq.

After all, the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature.


Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.



The Council regulation before us must be adopted to avoid a legal vacuum arising.

I will not go back over the technical reasons why these issues are sensitive: the 6/12 mile limits, protected areas, maintaining the principle of relative stability, regionalisation which can somehow be interpreted as renationalisation.
We should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower.
We do believe that there should be objective and independent criteria on how the system is managed, with incentives offered for the achievers and penalties offered for those who do not meet the desired levels.

We do not consider it appropriate to initiate the procedures needed to suspend the Association Agreement or to convene an extraordinary session of the Association Council which would probably be reported in the media but which would have no practical effect in specific terms.

The last part of section 4 of our opinion, following the words "Community action programmes should cooperate" , is to be deleted.
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.


I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here, as a former Member of Parliament.




Indeed, as regards agriculture, we believe that it is vital to set up a fund to tackle the enormous problems in the primary sector.

I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.


Mr President-in-Office, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly as your presence here symbolises what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already referred to. By that I mean the political symbolism of the fact that during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to listen to the European Parliament.
I have seen often enough how right-wing extremists have harassed - or attempted to harass - foreigners, or even those who hold different beliefs.
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.


I would like, on behalf of my Group, to complain that barely any public debate is entered into in these matters, and that changes happen so fast that sometimes it feels as if not even all our governments can fully influence this process.

Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.





- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, on her work, and say that, in fact, this price package is no longer as important as it has been in the past, since, fortunately, it has started to turn into the presentation and definition of agricultural policy in the medium term.
Rarely perhaps is the linguistic diversity of Europe seen so incredibly clearly as in a debate in this Chamber in which eleven different languages are being interpreted between.

What you should have done, Commissioner Byrne, was to apply directly for four years, if it was going to take four years, especially as this would have given a sign to the Member States.
yann__: I might need it for the Dutch site :)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, war is always cruel, and civil war even more so.

Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant.


I would say to the Commissioner, please accept our amendments in relation to this area.

We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere.


It is not by chance that, while they have not complied with any of their commitments, they protest that they have not been given the appropriations provided for under customs union.
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.
It is therefore vital to establish a system of information and preventive education for both young people in the countries concerned and also clients who are often what we would call 'family men' .

In particular, we believe it is right that the directive and regulation line up to provide as seamless as possible a regime for the protection of industrial design across the Union as a whole.
These are two aspects of the overall complex and I therefore hope that the Council really is wise and clever enough to accept the proposed amendments which we shall probably adopt by a large majority tomorrow.
I believe that the Commission is preparing - and in this sense I would be grateful for a comment from Mrs Wallström - a proposal on the inclusion of the environmental principle as a necessary consideration when awarding public contracts, and I therefore think it appropriate to await the approval of that proposal.

It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.
Allow me to conclude my speech by talking about children - our greatest gift, the most precious thing we have.
Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there.
This is why Mr Monti, a few months ago, and now my fellow Commissioner, Frits Bolkestein, continue to make it a political priority.

But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members.
Their text adopted most of the amendments which Parliament had approved on first reading and, in particular, the Council put considerably more emphasis on the references to combating poverty and achieving the international development objectives, agreed on the basis of United Nations conventions and resolutions.
The statement is therefore welcome. In no way do we oppose it.
Above all, integration mechanisms should be created.






Also, Amendment No 1 tabled by the competent Committee seems to clash with the objective of this specific long-term loan.



Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Damião for her magnificent report, despite the fact that it contains a series of criticisms of the Commission' s actions.
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.


The times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over.
The other absolutely crucial point I would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution: the political weakness of the euro system.
At the same time we understand the stir caused among the various political parties and public opinion as it recognises the magnitude of the reforms that country must agree to introduce before it joins the Union.
The list of illegally traced ivory is already so extensive that a legal hunt would only exacerbate the problem.

It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer.
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.
In Lisbon you will clearly be trying to lift the world or, in any case, our world, the world of Europe.

Investment in methods of dealing with waste in as environmentally friendly ways as possible is discussed well enough in point 8.


how do I change it
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.
The action of the Commission also applies to the laws of Member States.

Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the committee responsible. He has produced a very coherent opinion.
So, whoever tries to change the situation in the Brussels periphery using this convention will implicitly put the future of the Belgian constitutional equilibrium at risk and illustrate once again that a European lack of insight into our federal system can lead one to think that we would be better off as the separate Member States of Flanders and Wallonia, rather than as a federal Member State of Belgium.

The European directive on electricity was therefore adopted rather late by my country and only in its most basic form.
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The list includes numerous political representatives from several European Union countries (Denmark, Italy, Greece, Sweden and Spain) and also from non-Member States, together with a large number of journalists, clergymen, members of humanitarian organisations etc. Despite the uproar caused by this list, the Turkish Government has not denied its existence.
This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred.
At the European Council in Biarritz, the Convention members will be ready to propose a comprehensive text which is to include economic and social rights.
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.
As for Article 7, which is in fact a Portuguese proposal that I was able to present to the Reflection Group which prepared the previous Intergovernmental Conference, this article establishes a specific mechanism, and this is the point to which the honourable Member' s question refers, for taking action against any Member State which seriously and persistently breaches the principles mentioned in the previous article, Article 6.
I have the impression that this question is being avoided on both sides of the Atlantic, which will compromise future cooperation.
Whenever the issues go beyond this scope, the meetings are extended to all the Member States as is laid down.


Perhaps the best all-round solution is to carry on as I have been doing for the past 15 years - I too was a smoker in the past - and not smoke at all. Then the problem will only exist on a very small scale.
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.



Secondly, we have today noted with satisfaction that attempts are being made to reach a common solution to at least one other conflict regarding child soldiers.
In order to meet these objectives, the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house, or rather their home.
yep
I understand what you are saying. We have taken note of this.


CD's that is.

Mr President, firstly my congratulations to Mr Goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation.
This remains necessary due to the relentless violation of human rights - the execution of the death penalty by stoning springs to mind, as well as the constant disruption of international television programmes.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

If our Moroccan partners are now prepared to return to the negotiating table and show willing to negotiate, then I am sure that, in the end, we shall broker a solution which is acceptable to both sides.


seb128: :-)
This is why it is necessary to have a sufficiently long period of rest from work before giving birth and even longer afterwards, when there is a child to breastfeed, look after and bring up.
It is true that the Council is co-legislator alongside the European Parliament, which does not fit into the pattern of the clear separation between executive and legislative power in the form that it may exist in a parliamentary democracy in the context of a State.
It is a democracy which shares many of our values and had a tradition of political tolerance when we still believed in the divine right of kings.
The human body is not a possession, it is nothing to do with 'having' , it is to do with 'being' , with being a living person, and it cannot therefore be reduced to a machine made up of components and gears, materials and functions.

It is at least as important today to make sure we preserve the precautionary principle for future needs as it is to take a decision on the banning of phthalates.

This is not possible in conventional agriculture.
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.
Where consumer rights are concerned, we believe that consumers should be entitled to bring claims in their place of domicile in the event of disputes relating to electronic commerce.
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.



The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be seen as complementing the European Convention on Human Rights, which we believe should be incorporated into the Treaty.
At the same time, there is an agreement by all parties not to increase the overall budgets and, in this respect, you have also heard my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, talk of our current budgetary difficulties resulting from new needs and matters of urgency, such as meeting the Union' s main political commitments following the war in Kosovo.

The Council and the Presidency attach great importance to the European Conference against racism "All Different, All Equal" which will be held in Strasbourg between 11 and 13 October 2000, in preparation for the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism.
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.
I want to make one other brief point, because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more forthright discussions about the many issues over which there are disagreements.
Firstly - and this cannot be repeated enough - we think that at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, a decision should be made in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor, which in its capacity as an independent body, will work to safeguard the financial interests of the European Union.
They will do so specifically by establishing eight sub-committees, which will now enable the Commission, in this case represented by Commissioner Verheugen, to rigorously prepare the screening exercise and also to start negotiations on public services and markets. These are negotiations which will increase the present level of trade liberalisation between the Union and Turkey.
The partnership has failed to meet the expectations raised by the countries participating in the conference.
The President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned three examples and I would like to refer to them specifically.

Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten

Mr President, the question troubling me over Mr Karas' report is whether we are actually asked to endorse an information campaign on the practical implications of the introduction of the euro, or a propaganda campaign in favour of it.

There is a food crisis in the Horn of Africa.
As far as we are concerned, what is at stake is the construction of a Citizens' Europe, something we are hoping and praying for in order to be able to continue to build Europe.
There is still too much hesitancy on this score for my liking.
tab for jump

It is a country, President, in which a civil war has raged for the past eighteen years - eighteen years which have seen the proportion of defence spending by the Sri Lankan government rise steadily.


enlightening?
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his efforts in moderating and reconciling the various interests so that Parliament can make a positive, consensual contribution to improving this excellent Commission proposal.


It is true that it was perhaps necessary at the beginning to apply the rules so rigidly, because new rules had to be applied, imported from the United States, in accordance with the continental legal tradition.
I have to say that it would be perverse to discuss the European Union' s strengthened response to racism without referring to recent developments which have been a landmark in establishing that the European Union is a community of values based on respect for human rights.
Naturally we must have the right information to support our action, but I have the same opinions as have been expressed here with regard to putting the precautionary principle into practice.

There again, perhaps Feira can point us in that direction.

- My Group and I are pleased to have voted for and supported the Ludford report which is concerning the important subject of the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.


I am wondering now if the Commission has carried out any other analyses.
Why is the Commission so passive - much more passive than in many other areas - when it comes to being the Guardian of the Treaties on the issue of protecting animals in transit?
- (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would thank the rapporteur for explicitly mentioning the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, although we regret that it has not been included in the report.
This particular provision deals with improved transparency, and, as I mentioned in my presentation to you earlier, we believe in the Commission that, in line with general policy, the citizens have a right to know the real dangers to which they are exposed, and what measures can be taken to protect them.




My starting-point, as was the rapporteur's, is that we should give European Union citizenship real meaning.
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?
tim1, no pager?

This includes clearly differentiating which tasks the European Union can and must take care of itself and which tasks come within the jurisdiction of the individual Member States, taking account of the fact that some Member States and regions have been promoting the new technologies and fostering their acceptance by their citizens for years now.
Respect for human dignity, as the Council decision rightly claims, first involves the uncompromising affirmation of the destructive nature of these abuses and also involves appropriate policies which, in Europe and in third countries, enable families to accommodate, educate and protect their children, and enable children to regain their essential points of reference, which are goodness, truth and beauty.
It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts.

The report does, of course, contain some of the main points, but we will have to decide upon the definitive text later on.
martin_: a window, icons, etc.
Marble2: totem-xine was pretty unstable for me. Use gxine.. simple, fast :)
We were also able to observe - and I think this should be stressed - that the Tunisian authorities are aware of this deficit, which they justified time and time again through the need to temper their political openness in accordance with their particular idiosyncrasies and culture as well as the danger to Tunisian society of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0083/2000) by Mr Bowe, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (11216/1/1999 - C5-0012/2000 - 1998/0072(COD)).
Amendments must either be tabled in the name of 32 Members or in the name of a political group and actually represent the position of that political group, not of the individual who happens to table them in the name of the group so as to circumvent the limitation on tabling rules in plenary.
Fujimori' s failure to take account of the condemnations of the OAS, and the warning of the European Union and other international bodies in relation to these elections, condemns that country to a form of isolation which will be to the detriment of the Peruvian people and will increase social and political tension.

Bumjubeo, login and edit your XF86Config

Let me add that it is also, of course, possible to consult the archives regarding administration of project budgets.
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.

However, we know that these were not the real arguments, since they did not apply the same criteria to other third countries with which they concluded agreements nor to private agreements with various operators, including some from the European Union.
But I do not believe that we can solve the problem by paying fees for fishing quotas under a new agreement with Greenland.


It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.


The third reason is that, as well as the interpreters, there are many others behind the scenes who have to work until the end of the sitting to ensure that, for example, the Minutes are ready for tomorrow.





For example, these include higher security standards for credit cards or electronic immobilisers for cars.

Directives ought essentially to be aimed at establishing goals, not at regulating the details and describing the path to the goal.
Needless to say, it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone.



All of this demonstrates that Agenda 2000 has been nothing but a great firework display.
I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures.


Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.




By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.
I would like to assure you that this action is not intended to intervene in an area that, the report rightly notes, is market-driven.
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.
Mr President, one minute is a very short time for such a serious topic.

In my opinion, it should be included in the next amendment of the COM in fruits.

Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your comments.



The debate surrounding globalisation and free trade has received increasing attention.


I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.

The Feira Summit was in many ways an interim meeting prior to the French Presidency.
However, I would like to underline a few issues.

2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bob2	the directory doesn't matter
Mr President, further to yesterday' s minutes, I would like to express my great disappointment at the fact that even fewer than 200 Members attended the votes yesterday.
The Commission has a job to do as a catalyst for the process.

We know, for example, that in order to use the services of a smuggler, it costs a Chinese national between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 and years of illegal work to repay this debt. They generally live under constant threat, without rights or any protection, often in horrific conditions.

Ports are required to draw up waste-processing plans and to ensure that there are waste-processing plants or organisations that implement these plans.
Yes, it is backward in terms of the development of e-commerce made possible by the Internet.



tritium, how would I do that?

However, from that income the ECB has to deduct the interest it pays on its liabilities in euros vis-à-vis the national central banks.

OTPOR, the real resistance group in Serbia, which grew out of the student movement, is as at present being prevented by Milosevic from registering as an organisation.
Given the real risk of losing focus, I should like to issue a warning to the Commission.
Let me turn to the 14 amendments adopted by Parliament.
We are responding to that request.
Mr President, this is the second time today that we have talked about a report which will help us all to sleep, particularly the elderly.
Secondly, it wants to improve the terms and conditions of employment for pregnant workers and new mothers by way of extra maternity leave and specified minimum pay levels.





According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.
In my opinion, the aid which the European Union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Turkey.
But I believe that in order to bring about a European research area, we will need more than measures in the sphere of infrastructure.
You are also aware that the Commission will have to make proposals again next year on various organisations of the market, especially the sugar market, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, has stated that he will make a proposal in this regard, which will lead to savings of EUR 300 million a year.
In order for the target of zero road fatalities to be realistic, more use must be made of public transport so as to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.
I also know how hard it is to act as opposition in this situation, and not to despair or give up.
In its opinion on the 2001 budget, our committee has this afternoon approved the draft which our Vice-Chairman, Mrs Miguélez, had presented us, to increase budget line B7-8000 (International fisheries agreements) by EUR 7 million, thereby re-establishing the amounts in the preliminary draft budget presented at the time by the European Commission.
In the long term, we would stress the implications of a more intensive trading partnership with China for peace in Asia, Europe and the world as a whole.



However, we oppose the annual report on human rights being used to promote further integration within the EU.
Secondly, NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding.
Mr President, Portugal has also been affected by these tragic forest fires which have been the result either of natural causes or of criminal acts motivated by base economic interests.

The champions of the libertarian ideology never miss the chance to list a whole series of demands, each more ludicrous than the next, all wrapped up in proper sentiments.



Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector.

Could you ask the Committee on Rules of Procedure to look at the following point: we all respect the principles of power with responsibility and subsidiarity so every time a group asks for a recorded vote could a certain sum be debited from the budget allocated to it by Parliament?
What has happened to the respect for human rights, which must condition who the European Union helps or cooperates with, and which you adapt to suit your own ends?
Mr President, there are different types of undeclared work.
However, named members of Railtrack, the infrastructure company, and of Balfour Beatty possibly face manslaughter charges as a result of this accident.










However, we all know that at present data is already being circulated in practice, but in an unregulated way.

At the expense of repeating myself, this will ensure that it is to the citizens' advantage.

We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control.
I address you as a Frenchman - even though I appreciate that your nationality has nothing to do with your role as President - for the EU has a French Presidency now, of course, and, as far as I know, it is in France' s interests for the Parliament to remain in Strasbourg.




This potential must be exploited to the full, especially as the Union has not been capable of reacting quickly enough and the instruments for funding operations of this type were not flexible enough.
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.
As Mr Bourlanges is not yet here, I should like to give Mr Virrankoski the floor for five minutes.

And yet that is what we are doing today.

The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.
But we must watch out - it could be the calm before the storm, because there is every sign of a storm brewing.

We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible.









I was greatly shocked by the news that the Church which I belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society.

I tabled some amendments to Mrs Grossetête' s excellent report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, prompted by the concern that the legal protection of the citizens we represent is given insufficient recognition and enforcement in the individual countries.
On the one hand, it is worth mentioning the over-commercialisation that is affecting sport, as well as the saturation of sporting calendars and greater demands on sportsmen and women, both physical and mental.
By means of a policy that affirms the value of immigration, we can put a stop to the organised crime and the human tragedies that people smuggling is to blame for.

How strongly is the single market established at the moment?

This procedure applies to a greatly increased range of legislation, yet there has been less need to resort to conciliation.


Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, in particular its rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the timely initiative to bring the debate on this issue to the European institutions.

We can do this by driving a hard bargain, yet remaining specific, regarding the planned reforms in Zimbabwe.

Many thanks for your report and your skill, Mrs Read.
The reduction of EUR 150 million made by the Council in comparison with what the Commission is asking for, takes account of the stock of still unpaid commitments still on this programme, and that represents several years of implementation.


The same applies to the information to be included on the label and to the interpretation of the concept of origin.


I do not mean that we have to allocate to pensioners, the elderly and their problems the same proportion of our budget as they occupy of society, i.e. approximately 32% at the last count.



The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.

We quite understand that the economic content of the agreement is intended to bring about improvements, but we also recognise that we have not been able to achieve our aim of shifting the tremendous weight of North American influence that bears down on Mexico and other Latin American countries like a jackboot.
He told me he had not read the Wise Men' s report, but that did not stop him from writing in his statement, with reference to the report of the Three Wise Men, that the problems of racism and xenophobia would endure.

Would we obtain better solutions, however, if decision-making were, in every conceivable case, to be centralised in Brussels? Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties?




It is therefore all the more extraordinary that 50 years after the signing of the Convention of Human Rights, which ironically was signed in Rome, and one year after the Treaty of Amsterdam upholding such rights, that one European family, which for a thousand years has been involved with the continent's history, is being denied the fundamental rights my colleague has mentioned.

Future generations will not forgive us if we allow irreplaceable habitats to be destroyed, whose preservation we actually voted for eight years ago when we adopted our report on the habitats directive and then again in 1997 with the changes to the annex of the directive.

This is not only because in most cases, in this type of contract, the sums involved today are, as we know, relatively small. Also and above all, it is because the speed with which these contracts are concluded by electronic means is in stark contrast to the excessive formality and slowness with which courts tend to act when resolving these disputes.
Mr Duff, yesterday a vote was taken in the House on the Buitenweg report, as a result of which, the Karamanou and Sörensen reports have to be put to the vote this morning.

If we want to speed things up, then it is important to speed up the consideration of things like our new financial regulation.
I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions.

These rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement.

Saving energy goes hand in hand with reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as agreed under the Climate Protection Agreement.

Fishermen are discarding thousands of tonnes of saleable fish and going bankrupt in the process, yet while this economic and conservation disaster is in progress, the EU is proposing to spend over EUR 7 million to give Greek, Spanish and Italian fishermen access to the waters.
These are the extreme left-wing ideas represented in this House.
The debate on reforms in the sphere of flax and hemp grown for fibre has been going on now for almost five years, if you take 1996 and the proposals which the Commission made then as the starting point.
All the inquiry reports from the Danish and German Ministries of Transport show that there are neither environmental nor financial problems with building a bridge.
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.


You cannot continue to insist that you alone are right and that we are all mistaken.




Nevertheless, the economic exploitation of peat is important in those areas where there is a lot of marshland.

Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.



The issue of those held in prison is an important one, and I would like to add to what Olivier Dupuis said on this: there are many people in Serbia who have been carried off into custody, and about whose fate we know nothing.
The airspace must be accessible under the same conditions for general, commercial and military aviation, which does not mean that we should not give priority, or indeed exclusive access, to the military in the event of crises.
During the debate and also during the efforts to agree on a compromise amendment, it emerged that there is a large majority who are of the same view as regards policy and substance.

This Experts Group on terrorism was confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, clearly demonstrating the need for a body within which the representatives of the fifteen Member States have the opportunity to meet to exchange views and cooperate.
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.

As chairman of this committee, I have discovered that your loyalties are spread very wide.
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.


I wonder why, as a committed Europhile, I find myself disagreeing in this debate with many other committed Europhiles and specifically the rapporteurs.

By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.


The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where.

As such they would be unlikely to improve on current nuclear installations' safety standards.

actually it might not be in restricted, haven't checked
They maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale.
Free choices which people make in their private lives, and which do not harm anybody, should be honoured, with respect for diversity and with a guarantee of the principle of equal treatment.
Of all the applicant countries, not one single country has ratified it, and Turkey did not even sign it.
However, I would like to point out that we should also make use of our experience of managing other funds, especially the Structural Funds, in order to involve local and regional administrations and the organisations representing civil society in this management, in addition to the Member States.

We must address this issue now.
This is both embarrassing and distasteful.


But let us not forget that we must also set out more general requirements in relation to pollution from cars, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in developed societies and in our towns, and let us put pressure on the Commission to introduce policies to shift traffic off the roads and onto the railways and public transport.
Although it is necessary to fight fraud, we must also prevent the complexity of the system causing a multiplication of minor formal irregularities and farmers being unfairly penalised.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.
This system should enable any potential threats to human health to be tackled early and effectively.
If the Ludford report is not changed for the worse by amendments, the minority which I represent here will vote for this report.
The time has therefore come to tame the automobile.

The working time directive will not be complete until these issues have been resolved.
In actual fact, there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform.
So it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy.
But you would have my support, anyway.

Refugees are socially and legally marginalised or driven into the world of illegal immigrants.




For my part, I shall also ensure that internal Commission procedures are reformed in a way to speed up delivery.




Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.
The wording proposed in the new amendment for the regulatory procedure with the right of scrutiny, and I quote: "in the case of the codecision procedure based on Article 251, Article 8 thereof" leads to legal uncertainty and is not in line with the agreed implementation of Council's comitology decision.
We have a responsibility to pensioners to concern ourselves, as well as with all the other important aspects of fisheries, with how the national States protect retired fishermen, as they are the last to receive sufficient protection in the area of pensions.
This could take up to three months.

The importation and exportation of crimes does not recognise the EU' s external borders.
I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible.

cenerentola: hi ;)
It is possible if we invest to a greater extent in what Mr Guterres yesterday called 'human capital' , i.e. basic education plus, most importantly, lifelong training.
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.



It is a point about openness, about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here.
We fully approve of the breakdown he presented to us, which received such an ovation, and we support his initiative.

Mr President, during the Sierra Leone debate in December, I, together with a few other delegates, warned against the risks involving the Lomé peace agreement.
It is a fact that very few Members of the House are present here in Strasbourg on Friday mornings.
Some are purely humanitarian, for example rescue tasks.

lol
So it was certainly not a mobilisation summit, as the press described it.

Otherwise this will lead to further competition between the institutions.
I agree that this should be so, but to be successful in the future a model of full employment requires, above all, professional and socially secure jobs.


Therapeutic cloning entails creating an embryo by cloning only to destroy it afterwards, in order to remove cells for medical research purposes and, later perhaps, with a view to curing currently fatal diseases.
We have heard from those who fought against the Franco dictatorship, who are present today and are to be commended, but there are others, now dead, who no longer have a voice and can no longer participate in political dialogue.
college blocks bt?



The directive, which applied to various financial sectors, including banks, insurance companies, and so forth, is to be extended to other non-financial activities and professions which are nevertheless extremely vulnerable to money laundering.


However, we need to bear in mind that, with this draft, we have deviated a long way from the first reading, in view of the fact that only untreated timber was then regarded as an acceptable exception.




In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.
i know shes gonna miss her amarang
To this end, the European Union is prepared to send a mission of election observers, but must, of course, warn the Zimbabwean authorities of the need for satisfactory guarantees that the observers will be safe and that they will have freedom of access to all relevant premises.

To be meaningful the precautionary principle should be invoked only when there is a clear and demonstrable risk.

You mention changing the criteria, if necessary.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate my fellow MEP, Mr Parish, on an extremely good report.
In Britain, 70% of people are opposed to joining the euro.
And what exactly should be done?


We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent. Those are the sorts of ways in which the Commission is contributing to preventative diplomacy and I hope that in future Europe will manage those tasks in a more coherent way.

In any case I hope it gives you a good foundation for starting your work on the budget and that it will contribute to the establishment of a budget for 2001 which respects the priorities of each of the institutions, one which is satisfactory in terms of our joint mission, fulfilling our responsibilities towards Europe and its peoples.
We certainly all agree here in this Chamber that education is of vital importance and that an educated workforce is the cornerstone of Europe's future prosperity.
The current proposal therefore aims to give Member States the option of authorising the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to chocolate products up to a maximum of 5% of the total weight of the finished product.

This is my main concern in this matter.

And so really, this report could also be viewed as an appeal to the Convention that goes like this: 'Dare to do something at long last!

The ELDR Group has requested split votes on various items within the Joint Motion for a Resolution, as follows: in paragraph 7 we seek to delete the second half of the sentence in order to reinforce the imperative of enlargement; in paragraph 9 we seek to remove the last clause because we know that the Lebanese government is indeed trying to reassert control over all its territory, but is prevented from doing so by forces beyond its control; in paragraph 14 we seek to delete the reference to Nato on the grounds that all EU member states are directly concerned with this issue; in paragraph 19 we seek to delete the reference to the Observatory of Industrial Change; and in paragraph 24 we seek to focus the text on the political message needed for Feira.
I consider proposed Amendments Nos 28 and 29 to be particularly important.
That is all well and good, but there are also old, sleeping commitments and you may be interested to know that another 20 posts were recently made available, in addition to the 60 posts decided for the SCR last December, in order to see which commitments no longer apply and can be cleared up.





I endorse what Mr Watson said because here Mr Swoboda is also confirming to the present government that better relations are now being established with this Monitoring Centre.



Every question I now want to ask the Commission comes from that experience.
The annex to the directive contains a list of fabric and leather products in which the use of these suspect substances is banned.

I can assure the House that he intends to continue this dialogue throughout the internal approval procedures of the European Union.
We therefore view the Commission' s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction.

Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons.



LostMonk: Yeah, check out the first option (file?)
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.



This is whom discharge is addressed to, even though it concerns the administration.

davybondo, no problem :) if you still have problems after reading, come back here :)
I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out.

I therefore welcome the Council' s current proposal and Mr Kirkhope' s report with open arms.
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.
This is not an idea we have plucked out of the air.

Please support the Austrian people against this government!


This would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake.

We do this in the full knowledge that the e-economy is evolving at a rapid pace.
.... because this debate has shown that I was obviously mistaken, and I have no difficulty whatsoever in admitting this!


It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail. Indeed this is a matter which falls under the subsidiarity principle, and the European Commission would not wish to do anything which could compromise this principle.




|-)



Mr President, I very much welcome the establishment of courts to try the suspects of the former Communist Khmer Rouge regime.
In response to your query, I can tell you that the question is constantly raised as to whether OLAF is already involved in the procedure or intending to become involved before this bureau starts work.
We all know, without bothering to be diplomatic about this, that the role and representation of women in the decision-making process, either within the CFSP or generally within other structures, is inadequate.

Ladies and gentlemen, I put it to you that we decide as follows: we shall carry on the debate as scheduled on the agenda and tomorrow, the House will consider whether the vote should be retained as scheduled, after consultation with the various groups.


We must make use of regional policy on both a large and a small scale.
The Commission too was very, very critical of the common position because it was far too limited in relation to the original text.
It is clear from how it has operated to date, as documented in the recent experts' report, that we do not need simply to supplement Regulation 302/93, as suggested by the Commission. We need to amend it as described in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure, making water and airborne infectious disease rampant.


I should also like to thank the Commission for its willingness to provide the necessary information and also for preparing the report.


Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
That is why we have compensation for pain and suffering.
They have very little of it.
The number of opportunities can surely be counted in a shorter space of time than this.

My political group, like all of them, is going to comply with the regulations and provide information when it is appropriate to do so.
Mr President, Commissioner, sport is, of course, being discussed by a wide range of people and social groups right now, as the Olympic Games begin in Sydney.



I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.
welp i am off to work


Finally, on the knowledge society, it is very clear that we need to convert our thinking, not just at a technological but also at a social level.




This is something we have been hearing about for years, just as we have heard a great deal about the single market in the European Union for years.
We are aware that this obviously has an impact on the civilian population.
However, I am a little confused because the Greens in this House are maintaining that the common position is so weak that it is imperative that we make a huge number of improvements to it.
Furthermore, Recital 7 uses a standard form of words.
One of the premises for the application of the precautionary principle must be proportionality, which appears not to be the case here.


We continue to raise these issues at every level of the political dialogue with the Algerian authorities.
Please see to it that we have transparency; that is the great hope we place in your presidency.
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.
Those whose role and prestige makes them a point of reference for such a huge public and for all the institutions - such as the European Central Bank, which has our confidence - cannot permit themselves even a minor imperfection, and still less can they say, "Do what I say, not what I do" while advocating price stability, management efficiency and the greatest possible rectitude and transparency.
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.
The rapporteur' s succinct justification of his report expresses his misgivings on harmonisation with the fairly lax standards characterising the laws and common practice in some States, clearly showing the author' s desire to harmonise the right of asylum in the various countries of the European Union, but from the top.

I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.




Lastly, I would urge all Christian-Democrat Members to endorse this report by my Socialist colleague.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Madam President, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would like to congratulate Sweden on the Presidency. We think it is a good custom for the presidency to alternate.
This is, in fact, what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same thing. I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this.
Does the Council not believe that this case justifies the imposition of sanctions and makes it all the more important for the sanctions to be maintained?
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.

Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.


I am pleased to say that the rest of my delegation will be joining me in opposing it.
If the European governments do not change their attitudes soon, a treaty will be drawn up in Nice which guarantees to cripple the Union once it has been enlarged.




The excessive bank charges in force at present are giving precisely the opposite signal.



This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.




It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.

One clear result, of course, of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools.



I would ask for this to be considered.
However, it does not benefit the citizens.



This reworking, which moreover is included in the Commission action programme for 2000, is already in preparation.
This does not simply involve the free flow of ideas, labour, goods and capital, but also values such as respect for diversity, tolerance, equality before the law of the 'citizens of Europe' , irrespective of their national, ethnic and cultural affiliation or outlook.






One of the ways in which this is expressed is by lobbying for the President' s function to be strengthened and through parliament' s proposals to the intergovernmental conference.
That is why I cannot say...

As I understand it, what is being done at Temelín has already been done in Finland and there is similar upgrading work in hand at Kozloduy in Bulgaria with the support of a Euratom loan.

Unfortunately, I noticed too late that my name was not on the attendance register.
When the Commission then writes to complain about the questionnaires and working papers of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that shows that something has gone wrong with the flow of information between the controlling and the controlled parties and this must be rectified as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
The protocol goes only halfway towards the goal for acidification already agreed by Parliament and the Council.
It is vitally important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the project' s third and fourth phases into clear legislative proposals as soon and as effectively as possible.
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.
I am however afraid that the usual double standards may make these measures meaningless, for how credible are policies which would restrict the fight for human dignity to some parties and leave out others?
I was therefore amazed to learn that less than three months after the event, both Mrs Péry, on behalf of the presidency and Mrs Diamantopoulou, on behalf of the Commission had completely changed tack. I was really taken aback by this.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.

The only reason why we are not voting against the amendments, however, is to affirm our conviction that cooperation between Europe and the whole of Africa is essential.

As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out, we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens.
It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name.

As the author is not present, Question No 19 lapses.
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.



But the object of the exercise today is for the democrats to give thought to the tasks they face here and now.


At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.
I very much prefer this technique over and above the circuitous route developed in Great Britain, which is based on the reproductive technique.






(The President cut the speaker off)


I would appreciate your support in this.

The primary beneficiaries will be those who live in extremely disadvantaged rural areas where the consequences of the disaster are most acute.
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.
This was hailed as good news when, in fact, the situation was just as worrying as an increase in the price to USD 34.
The problem of refugees, which include many Georgian citizens of Greek descent, has not been solved.
They indeed need to be more limited, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has taken up this issue, because the issue is in the area of what consequences these comprehensive exemption provisions will have for monitoring currency holdings.
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.
Let me now outline a few points in the resolution, not in order to reopen the debate, Mr President, given the late hour, but in order to put a few brief comments to you.

One of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to tailor the veterinary and plant-health conditions prevalent in the acceding countries to those in the European Union.

They will create a State within the State and make decisions on behalf of everyone else.
. (FR) I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak about this report, which was drafted in response to a request by the European Parliament in the framework of negotiations on the revision of the budget for the first phase of Socrates, in 1998.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)
These substances, phthalates, are a very large constituent of the toys concerned -and quite large percentages may be present in them.
The Commission is right to demand its right of association under the Treaty and, through that, for this Parliament to demand its right of accountability and scrutiny.





Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report.

I have quite a few questions.
But transparency is a principle that we must hold dear in this context.
Furthermore, it obliges ships to deliver all ship-generated waste to the port, except where the ship has a sufficient storage capacity to enable it to arrive at the next stage, the next port.
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.
I think this very case has shown that we need to revise the directive on patenting and that, above all, we need a moratorium on the patenting of human genes and parts of the human genetic make-up, for I believe that, with the granting of the present patent, the ethical and social consequences have become more than clear.

The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.

The Council responded by saying that it was not in favour of that kind of control.

The USA and Britain imposed a no-fly zone in April 1991.

2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan, hrm, I haven't tried it myself but I will be trying it soon, pci should be no problem...


If the Palestinian Authority collapsed, it would be a very severe blow to prospects for peace in the region, Israeli security would be threatened and our efforts to promote cooperation and stability in the Middle East would be undermined.






Mr President, honourable Members, this debate is about fighting crime - organised crime to be precise - which is now responsible for at least one in four of all crimes, and which makes huge profits from drug crimes, trafficking in human beings, insurance and credit card fraud, and from other activities.


In my view, the Brussels convention is of major strategic importance for the development of e-commerce within the internal market and it will also have a major impact on the success or failure of small- and medium-sized businesses.


I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.
This is what it is all about at the end of the day.

I am firmly against that kind of anti-European mood and I place my hopes in this House.

Last year, the Commission carried out a study which revealed that, if we do not make radical changes to the qualification and professional training systems, by the year 2010, the skills of 80% of those currently in employment will be outdated, and this will exacerbate existing inequalities and open up new gulfs. The answer is lifelong learning and a large-scale investment in technical skills and knowledge.


It would weaken the control that they currently have over it.


Now, considering the forthcoming 2000-2006 programming period, even though management has been simplified and the number of objectives and Community initiatives reduced, I cannot contain my concern and I sympathise with many regional council chairmen as they tackle the issue of the failure to use Community funds and the responsibilities of the Italian Government.
do you know how to switch to console mode?

I think it is indeed time that the Commission intervened in a support regulation for flax and hemp.
We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves.
However, we do have to introduce something different: we have to find a way of assessing our progress and providing public opinion with tangible facts, and we therefore have to use a benchmarking system.
We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive.

We might well question how this should be done. How can we help women?

May I insist on the need for an ambitious approach.

But I also think that this is a call directed at the Council rather than a call directed at us, notwithstanding what has been submitted to us parliamentarians so far from the preliminary draft budget for evaluation.
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.

Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.
All the major players in the Swedish tourist industry have already promised to comply with a special code of conduct.
High-speed links must, first and foremost, be designed for tourism, leisure and the enjoyment of all European citizens, especially the elderly, who would be avid travellers if conditions were more luxurious and rail travel a more pleasurable experience.

However, although disability is included as one of the forms of discrimination which Article 13 is intended to combat, the package of measures does not include a specific directive designed to counter discrimination based on disability.

left to fire
However, I was in Rotterdam all day yesterday, from early morning until late last night and I was at the final.

On the other side of the coin, we read that there are still 15 million unemployed, the telecommunications and Internet services sector is underdeveloped, there is a widening skills gap in information technology, structural long-term unemployment, too many state monopolies and fetters, competitive disadvantages vis-à-vis the USA and shortcomings in the implementation of European innovations.

We are keen to use this instrument to promote economic and social development in Turkey.
Mr President, Commissioner, what is positive about this compromise is that obstacles to cross-border freight traffic will be dismantled in the foreseeable future, which definitely improves our chances of being able to transfer freight from the roads to the railways.

At the same time, and here Mr Duisenberg is being too evasive for my liking, we also want the European System of Central Banks to give its unequivocal support to the European Union' s general economic policies.
Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur, in particular, for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market?
I fear that this framework agreement will basically perpetuate the policy of inadequate transparency that we have seen in recent years, instead of seizing a genuine opportunity and finally attempting to do justice to our remit by ensuring greater transparency and preventing the Commission from continuing to take refuge behind confidential documents.
What is longhorn?

I think this is no longer acceptable, or necessary, for that matter, and that we must make every effort, and employ all means, in order to change this situation.

I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs.


Last time we covered twelve with Portugal as the country holding the presidency.
One such country is the Netherlands, initially presented as a role model for all other Member States and gradually relegated to curiosity status.
Perhaps, politically, it helps those who we say want an economic Europe; however, it does not help the political Europe which interests the European Parliament.
We will continue to address the issue of preserving national identity and the need to maintain a set of instruments which, without in any way distorting the competition rules, can, in some way, ensure that the core values of European identity will be preserved. This applies both to the overall position adopted by the Council, which will, of course, remain the focal point of the negotiations conducted by the Commission on behalf of the Union during the next round, and also at national level.



Fishing and tourism, as the two chief resources in most of the regions on our Atlantic coastline, have therefore both been hard hit.

The Commission deeply deplores and condemns this situation and calls all parties in the conflict to respect humanitarian law and principles.
As long as it does not do this and is blind to other shortcomings, it is not an independent medium.
The broad guidelines of European economic policy developed in this report seem to be heading in the right direction.
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.

I think, therefore, that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach.

At the present time, it is extremely difficult for a European company with a line serving, for example, Paris, Houston and San Francisco, to board passengers in California, as this is legally considered as cabotage, whereas an American company serving New York, Madrid or Paris, may board passengers in Spain for disembarkation in Europe.
This military equipment is apparently going to be used to destroy cocaine plantations.

If this is so and censorship is taking place, it means that the freedom of the press does exist there, to the extent that the local press can even refuse to report any of Tunisia' s positions which do deny human rights.
I would like the Commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the EU.

In the area of foreign policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the EU has decided to develop the military and non-military dimensions in parallel.



On behalf of the European Council, I have pointed out the structure of bilateral and multilateral cooperation enabling our police and legal systems to relentlessly score points against terrorism.
The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates.


In any case, we should not forget that these countries, including Slovenia, have shown that in a relatively short time they have been able to adopt the rules that have taken a relatively long time to become established in the EU and in the European West.


When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.

This is the broad legal framework.
And I have been really surprised at the low level of interest aroused by one of this year' s most important reports from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - or rather, to tell you the truth, I have not been surprised at all.

tar xvfz *.tar.gz or *.tgz
Mr President, this report again demonstrates that liberalisation, the free market and competition are currently seen as the universal panacea to nearly every economic and other problem.

I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX.




It would be politically more responsible at this time to try and reduce the tensions. We must therefore particularly support the efforts which the authorities of the two countries have been making, especially through their respective Foreign Ministers, in order to prevent certain incidents from being exploited, for the sake of the overall situation which is itself of considerable significance and whose resolution may be vital to ensure the balance of the geographical area concerned.

We therefore need to roll up our sleeves, and we call on the Council to add this matter to the agenda.
Many of you here know my view on this issue.
Can you be sure, Commissioner, that an enlightened view will be taken, in particular by Mr Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition, to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union?
In the amendments to my report, we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed, including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market, either voluntarily or, if necessary, with legislation.
Will the Commission take account of the experience with NGOs acquired by staff in the Development DG when it draws up the establishment plan for the new implementing body?




We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.
they are free
That is not all, however. Behind the smugglers, we are beginning to see mafias operating to an ever-greater extent.
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!

This is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways' competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs.



We really do need external inspection and certification agencies.
Otherwise, when is it intended that the debate should take place?

Mr President, I am delighted that this report has been put before the House.


Transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the United States, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in Europe.

There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.

However, as President Chirac stressed, we must educate our young people, prepare them for the challenge of globalisation, and not only from a professional and cultural point of view. We must educate young people to stand up for principles, and the fight against drugs and the development of the social function of sport may well play a significant part in this.
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.
First of all, the speed at which the EU-wide railway sector is making headway is far too slow, both in terms of transport of people and goods.
I can still see the dreadful images from the seventies of the earthquake in Italy, and I can understand the sense of distress prevailing in El Salvador.



We think it very unfortunate that the Swedish Social Democratic Government has chosen not to pursue this issue more vigorously.


We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.

Our message must be an ambitious one.
Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement, there will be a possibility of increasing this figure, following extra demands on the budget by enlargement.
works like a charm now

All these points which I mentioned are also backed by the Liberal Group.



We support the percentage which has now been agreed upon, or at least the interpretation laid down in the Commission statement, namely 30%, certainly in the light of the review clause which has been adopted. In this clause, it is agreed that, three years after the entry into force of the directive, it will be examined whether the volume of waste delivery has increased or whether a situation has been created which requires either a higher percentage level or a review of the system.
When he met you, the Norwegian negotiators introduced you as 'enemy number one' , and yet after the very tough negotiations, you went to visit him in Tel Aviv, and you went for a walk on the sea front, he says, away from all the media pressure, and, ahead of the thinking of the time, discussed how, after the historic breakthrough in Oslo, you might establish a sustainable and equitable peace, as you have said.





This framework includes good relations with Armenia, especially on trade matters.
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.
A few years ago, I had the privilege of inviting the current President and Prime Minister here as private individuals.

Finally I would like to stress that there is potential for increased cooperation with Zimbabwe, but this will clearly depend on how the situation develops there.

2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	my network is mostly unfirewalled
If the Commission really believes that the future of European fisheries depends not on the simple modification of a regulation, but on the proposal of measures already contained in current regulations, if the Commission' s great proposal and great discovery for the future CFP is to be multiannual TACs and the encouragement of aquaculture, perhaps the moment has come, Mr President, to ask in all seriousness for it to make room for other people who can bring in new ideas and the tiniest sense of responsibility.
The stores down there are empty.

We do not hesitate to sign trade agreements with China, a totalitarian country if ever there was one, which ordered 1800 executions last year alone - that is the official total - and at the same time, we allow ourselves to pass judgement on the Tunisian government with what is, to my mind, uncalled for severity.

Mr President, the paragraph 13 which emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, states that the Legal Affairs Committee agreed to request biennial reporting, that is to say, reporting every two years.
I would like to draw your attention to the plan for Thursday' s sitting, which has the debate on reports continuing after 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m..
Having said that, Madam Vice-President, we are grateful to you for the fact that your statement - which is, after all, of crucial importance - does at least, in effect, secure a bottom line of 30% as the amount agreed by the Council and Parliament, and we are relying on the Council to act on your statement accordingly.

In this regard, I have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind.

We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade.
This means that the sums set aside for this purpose will also mainly be spent in these countries.
Christianity contributes to the catalogue of values of the European Union, but there are also other currents which have found their way into the catalogue of values of the European Union and I think it is important that we establish this once and for all.
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The Council and the Commission will, as soon as possible, be examining what measures are possible in order to open the European market to North Korean products.
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.
Mr President, I think there is a mistranslation in the Swedish text. It would have been a turn-up for the books if the European Left had expressed its concern about a possible increase in taxes on income from capital.
pitti, did you noticed that 2.0.3 is for 2.6.9??
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.

As soon as the earthquake occurred the Commission humanitarian aid office, ECHO, directed a field expert stationed in Honduras to go directly to the scene and he was there by Sunday.

One great merit of this piece of work is the importance which the rapporteur and Parliament attach to consumer-friendly dispute-resolution mechanisms and the pressure they have brought to bear in order to obtain these.
This would mean that we could make far-reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy, for business initiative, to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments: to be up-to-date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies.

Anyway, to summarise as quickly as possible, important progress was made in recognising women' s rights as human rights. Very positive political statements were made in terms of rejecting any violations of these human rights, eradicating all practices which violate human rights, referring to the Commission on the Status of Women and the optional protocol and combating racism and violence based on racial grounds.
There are those who commit the crime and there are those who aid and abet.



The talks at Taba were also suspended, at least officially, even though they did manage to make progress in terms of setting up committees on matters such as borders, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees.
This is our view as well: Europe must be able to develop an effective foreign policy which is in line with the fundamental values which we always claim to hold: respect for international laws and human rights. In terms of Palestine, that means upholding the UN Resolutions.
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.
Allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations.
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.
We request that this agreement should also be translated into Turkish, as an official language of the Republic of Cyprus - not only into Finnish, Swedish, Danish, German and so forth, but also into Turkish.

The system of sport which the European Union must aspire to must make the right to sport for all citizens a practical reality and aim to preserve the social function and traditional values of sport, while taking into account its economic and legal development.

Member States will have to do some of the things that will let them meet proposed emissions ceilings more cheaply if they are to live up to their Kyoto commitments.
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.




As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.

Social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family.




I do not see any obstacles to future harmonisation of rules in the field of safe management of radioactive waste and decommissioning of nuclear installations.

This is precisely why, given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of NGOs, we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue.

As long as these third country nationals are refused political rights, they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination.

Women should not just bear half the sky on their shoulders, but also have the right to take responsibility for decisions affecting our entire earth. Is that not so, Commissioner?

As part of this European effort, it is becoming essential to ensure that all of this action, that is any future action that we may take in this area, relates to a very clear body of principles, capable of providing the public with clear and transparent legal protection.
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.
Through the Treaty changes proposed in the resolution, the EU would become a Union wholly dominated by the big Member States.

It was not easy to reach a consensus: when we were negotiating the Treaty of Amsterdam, and I took part in those negotiations, it was not easy to reach a consensus on including the various measures now covered in Articles 6 and 7.
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.

Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.
I am talking about a Union of principles and a Union that we have to strengthen - there will not be a political Union in the future if we cannot guarantee that these principles are shared by the great majority of the Community.
It was one of the best football matches I have ever attended. The atmosphere was anything but hostile.
Since we last discussed this subject, Germany' s supreme commander has resigned in protest, which is as good a sign as any.

In the course of this debate, which will be held in the different institutions, the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication, both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights.

With the new EU-ACP Convention being successfully concluded a few months ago and with the EU-South Africa cooperation agreement now being implemented as planned, we have two very important additions to the MEDA cooperation and the Barcelona process.

This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.

All Member States now insist that they are giving top priority to the secure implementation of BSE-related measures.
We also support the committee' s position according to which expenditure set aside for a common foreign and security policy is operational expenditure, which must remain the budgetary responsibility of the Commission.
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.

It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward.
We agree, in particular, with the approach that consists of stating that improving judicial cooperation - or even, to use Mr Ferri' s words, "a radically new joint effort" - must never be seen as a weakening of the sovereignty of the Member States. Instead, this should be seen as a tool, and perhaps the most important tool, for making this sovereignty effective in the face of the sophistication and power of organised crime, which today poses an extremely serious threat to the structures of democratic government, to the very functioning of the rules of the legitimate economy and to respect for citizens' rights.

Cocoa butter is the very essence of chocolate.
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.





With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.

Huge volumes of goods pass through the European Union, which are then shipped outside the Union from its ports.



But if you approach us, Mrs de Palacio, and want us to defer this part, then I think you will need to offer us more than you have at the moment, as you well know. If you go back and negotiate, then one thing must be made clear and I hope and believe that the House is relatively united on this question: it must be clear that we need a declaration of unequivocal standards.
We were puzzled about what Mr Gama said, in his initial intervention, on the current state of the work in the IGC.

There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but, as Human Rights Watch notes, the struggle to control the press is, in many ways, the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole.

Mr President, I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now.

These are not just empty words as far as the Commission is concerned, which is why I have transferred all the confidential audit reports needed to the Committee on Budgetary Control, or rather to the rapporteur, during the course of the discharge procedure and which is why the Commission has also replied in detail to questionnaires, even though this differed from past reporting practice.



So we should not forget wood in the Sixth Framework Programme on Research - we should make sure that the priority area for wood is accordingly drawn up with due care, especially in the field of biotechnology.

This applies to Community legislation on the patentability of biotechnological inventions, which is expressly based on respect for the fundamental principles that guarantee human dignity and integrity. This legislation also affirms the principle that the human body, at all stages of its formation or its development, including germ cells, as well as the simple discovery of one of its elements or of one of its products, including the partial sequencing of a human gene, cannot be patented.
The goal of my colleagues who joined me in tabling this question to the Commission is this: the correct application of the EC-Israel trade agreement, which - we not only have reason to believe but, together with several Member States, have concrete proof - is being blatantly violated by Israel.

Consequently, I do not agree with Amendments Nos 3, 9, 10 and 12 nor, for similar reasons, with Amendment No 38.

Mr President, I have noticed with some degree of satisfaction that the subversive action staged by some of the Members with a view to sabotaging procedures has ground to a halt.

First, from the strategic and political angles, it is important for the European Union to build up its relationship with a country that is so important in that part of the world and which, above all, is making progress in terms of respect for the values of human rights.

It is not true to say that Ethiopia has not been crying for help for food aid over the past two years, but the war situation has blurred the vision of many looking on.

Significant financial support has been granted to Montenegro, so that since 1998 over EUR 115 million has either been spent or committed.
The package of measures which Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already presented is, in my view, an integrated proposal and may provide a convincing response to the racism and xenophobia which we are witnessing today in the European Union.
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.
Maybe we should learn something from that, though I agree that there are some important high-level retired politicians whom one would not want to see necessarily supervising elections. At which point discretion is the better part of valour.
It is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the Chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights.
Too many unnecessary interventions have been made, while the need remains for aqueducts, schools and the means for young graduates to build a life for themselves.
A second exercise will take place in March this year and I will continue to follow this up so as to give us a scoreboard of how Member States are implementing Community legislation.

The principle of cohesion considered in the Treaty must not come under threat during enlargement.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0532/00).

I would make two or three other very simple points.

Parliament must take notice of this, because if we allow Member States to contravene the law in this way it has serious implications for the European Union as a whole.
Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations.





The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.

Finally, Mr President, the Commission is willing to accept a number of other amendments and other modifications regarding the rights of family members, the conditions and clarification of the conditions for family reunification, the situation in which the person being reunited may acquire independent status, and concerning procedural rules.



lol

In any event, we should safeguard the Community preference and prevent any marginalisation of Community production.




In respect for the differences of opinion on the matter, we feel that it is vital to lay down ethical standards based on respect for human dignity in the biotechnology sector.





Mr President, the question we have heard several times in the course of this debate is this: what exactly is the point of this Charter of Human Rights, when there is already one, and even several universal conventions on human rights and a European Convention on Human Rights, and human rights are included in the constitutions of all the Member States, those of the candidate countries and, generally, in the constitutions of all countries, even those who do not respect human rights?

Madam President, could we take this matter into consideration?
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.
How is the outcome of the war in Kosovo to be appraised?

Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.
Address by Mr Kuçan, President of the Republic of Slovenia


I am very grateful to be able to follow my colleague, Philip Bushill-Matthews, because I share many of the concerns he has expressed.

It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.

Only by ensuring that we are not in a situation where the Council is giving less priority to the Mediterranean, the Commission is hindering the implementation of programmes and the European Parliament is simply giving lectures, will we be able to find the tone and effectiveness of a policy which will help the future of Tunisia, in friendship and solidarity, towards a situation which brings both socio-economic growth and full democratisation.
This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination.

A number of things have been said already about Morocco and I just want to say that we would insist that it is entirely up to Morocco, as a coastal state with sovereignty over its fish and its exclusive economic zone, to decide what it wishes to do with these resources.
The Minutes of this session will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the start of the next part-session, if there is no objection.
The fact that Parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important.

The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue, especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a ban on night flights in Zaventem which, following a hefty row within the government, was withdrawn soon after.




Has the strategic goal of sustainable development which was supposed to be an integral part of a twenty-first century economy, which would meet the requirements of the planet and its citizens, been forgotten?
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.
I can neither endorse them, nor the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group that suggest a need for further opening up on the path to liberalisation.
and a PS/2 keyboard



For this reason, I have tabled an amendment, not to the draft Convention, which, I am aware, cannot be amended, but to Mrs Schierhuber' s resolution.
This, moreover, is the message clearly expressed by the European Council in Lisbon, whose conclusions unequivocally refused to incorporate the Commission' s wish to reduce the agricultural budget by EUR 300 million in 2001, and by the same again in 2002.
Madam President, Commissioner, it will come as no surprise to you that I am not satisfied.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Peter Mombaur, and congratulating him on his skilled reporting. And having heard the contributions made today by the honourable members, we really can say that the liberalisation of the energy markets has progressed faster and more efficiently than we expected in the last parliamentary term.

I understand that, insofar as certain elements of the regulation are amended, we could also discuss the model for calculation of VAT used to determine own resources, but we are talking about a radically different problem.
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.
What concerns me more than anything is that this conflict could spread to other islands with similar problems and similar tensions.

may i aska fedora installation question here, if people dont mind?



It is true that the use of those systems has allowed, for example, certain countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria, but it is also true that their abuse can distort the picture of a country' s true accounts.
This is not a victimless crime.
I would also draw your attention to the fact that recently Mr Glavany, the French Minister of Agriculture, announced his intention of putting in place approximately 40 000 tests of the type that I have been discussing with you here this afternoon to determine the presence of BSE and the levels of infectivity in France.


And what form has this reaction taken?
I would like to draw your attention to three points, in particular, which seem essential to me if this summit wants to succeed as a major social summit.
It has the support of the shipowners because it provides them with waste facilities, which already exist in some European ports but unfortunately not in all of them, particularly not in the smaller ports, where the Member States will have to make significant investments.

But how much real responsibility will they have?
We must grasp this opportunity to redefine a European agricultural policy, without playing to the galleries in the manner of José Bové, but by developing a policy that fulfils the expectations of consumers and our farmers, to whom we are bound by a strong sense of solidarity.
Mr President, the political pressure that preceded the elections and the flagrant manner in which President Mugabe encouraged the violence means that we are not talking now about free and proper elections, although we were sincerely convinced on polling day itself that we were witnessing a desire to hold an irreproachable election.

The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.
Secondly, all of us have the task in the next few years of convincing public opinion of what I have just said.
However, I sincerely doubt that the Community institutions, swollen as they are with fine-sounding but half-baked principles, are mature enough to deal with the reality.
Surely we should be more selective.
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.

Treenaks: indeed
If enlargement means having a lot more heavy lorries on our roads, there will be opposition.

Regrettably, therefore, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 or 4.
I do not want to build up large structures where people create work while waiting for a crisis to happen.


The Commission also has to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.

Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.

the next meeting would be in three weeks  son the 11th
The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome.
Reform to our procedures, many of them determined by Member States in an era when NGOs barely existed, is going to take time but we are working on it, not least as part of the overall reform package.

It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.


No version of linux is all that great without an internet connection
This is an important step forwards, but let me remind you all the same that this White Paper is the follow-up to a Parliament resolution adopted in 1994, that is to say, six years ago.


I must say that these visitors wonder, naturally, whether this is what Europe is all about.
I also find other proposals on improving the right of asylum most interesting; they need to be quickly put into in practice.
Plans to finance projects which will meet the objectives of the regulation are already advanced.
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.
That programme will cover the period 2001-2006. Secondly, the budget line for trans-European networks will contribute risk capital financing, which could promote - and I hope this is the case - the creation of investment funds geared to the TENs and, to this end, we have already asked for expressions of interest.

Mothers now have three children instead of seven.

I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.

I personally take a different view on this.
As a matter of fact, the dioxin contamination has clearly shown how important rapid action is, in particular when a danger spreads from the feed to the food chain.


Members will have seen the communication on the development of the external service that was adopted by the Commission on 18 July.
For instance, the availability of carrier pre-selection should be considered, and this facility made available to consumers, if studies confirm that they are going to benefit from this pre-selection.


My fourth point is the inclusion of training for technical professions in audiovisual media, Amendment No 18, and radio, Amendment No 33.

Improved living conditions, employment and the quality of employment will continue to be intimately linked to our ability to make European research more dynamic.
So do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the IGC?
In order for any action related to the development of new projects for investment in these technologies to be launched, it will require a legal basis which will ensure that the laws on which it is based are transparent.
I fully support the rapporteur' s proposal that an annual report be drafted on human rights in the Mediterranean countries.
In the first decade of the new century and millennium, democratic Europe is also facing new trials.




In particular, I am thinking of the student movement, the virtually underground OTPOR movement, and on this subject, I think that the relentlessness with which it is suppressed and monitored by Milosevic' s henchmen is a good indicator of its power.

It was at the Luxembourg Summit in November 1997 that we realised the importance of looking more closely into these phenomena so as to avoid suffering them again and to counter their negative consequences.
Even if we are satisfied overall with the European Union' s humanitarian policy, and if we are generally happy with Mr Imbeni' s report, this policy must, to a greater extent, be in keeping with sustainable development.

Absolute account must be taken of the Economic and Social Committee' s reservations concerning strict limits on exemptions and harmonisation of veterinary legislation.
One more word on the habitats directive.
Jointly with the Member States, we are currently identifying what should go into this package.


I am convinced that the current political consensus in aid of a better legislative climate within the European Union will lead to real and permanent improvements.
Dr Mondragon, giving evidence in this Parliament earlier this month, showed that the fumigation of 22,000 hectares of illegal crops last year in Colombia did not prevent 38,000 hectares of new cultivation because the problem is one of no alternative for the peasant farmers.
Certainly a single European sky would increase the efficiency with which European air space is used.


Do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain.
There is therefore a lot of interest in these matters.
(B5­0354/2000) by Mrs Boudjenah, Mr Brie, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, Mr Manisco, Mrs González Álvarez, Mr Miranda, Mr Korakas and Mr Papayannakis, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the application of the death penalty in the United States;

Anyone can tell me what these 3 things mean? Assertion (heads < 256) at disk_dos.c:486 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
The Commission' s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable.
The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest.






Take for example my area, Asia, which keeps me extremely busy.
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.



The toxic effects of phthalates are insignificant, and they do not irritate the mucous membrane or the skin.
We are already in contact with many of them and we will seek to deepen that relationship.


Through the Commission' s aid programme, the EU is offering support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to grips with their environmental problems.

The court here in Strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights.
In this way, European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities.






If we do not, the European press will take each Member State in turn, they will look at the safety measures that are in those states and they will compare and then people' s confidence in beef in general will collapse.

I shall do my best to ensure that the vote on the MEDA budget is another stage confirming the importance we attach to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
However, I feel it is highly significant that Parliament is voting on and approving the texts - if that is the decision of the House, as it was the largely unanimous decision of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and as it is the desire of all the parliamentary committees which have expressed their opinion - and giving its assent before the Swiss referendum on 21 May.

I hope that will not be forgotten as this report goes through.
They are responsible for a delay of five months at most.

One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.

In other words, we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential, and even then in a spirit of great moderation.



Funding must be provided by public agencies within the framework of research activity programmes which will support both basic research and applications, the final purpose of which should be to improve the quality of life for all mankind and not swell the coffers of the monopolies.




hehe

On balance, I feel that a number of very serious problems and misdirected developments in EU energy policy have not been addressed.




I have many regrets in life and one of them is that I am not a lawyer, so if the honourable gentleman will excuse a scriptural reference, I tip toe on these waters with some nervousness!

I believe that the conciliation procedure was successful in the end, for we did at least manage to secure our demand for ships to have to pay a significant contribution towards the costs of the facilities, irrespective of how much they make use of them.

But, given the circumstances, I could not vote in favour of paragraph 8 on Austria.
As has been repeated a great many times, the biggest dispute, as we all know, has been about which court is to have competence in matters relating to electronic commerce.
Such practices are intolerable, but they are difficult to monitor, particularly at night or in foggy weather.

On the one hand, the directives were transposed extremely slowly throughout the Union.
We stand ready to help them in every way we can, politically and economically.

google knows all
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.
Within these limits, Amendments Nos 11, 37, 48 and 52 are therefore acceptable in principle.
The EU' s credibility will be in the balance, and in my opinion, this is a bad start for the further development of the EU' s foreign and security policy.
We must encourage them to do so.
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.
The rate of growth of payments is higher because we have a large backlog of payment commitments and the Commission currently takes the view that this should not get any bigger; on the contrary it should be reduced, which is precisely why the rate of growth for payments needs to be higher.

The real world simply does not work like that.

All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.

It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.

I had hoped that the Commission would go further, that it would have the courage, for once, to submit proposals, and that it would be able to do what the Council of Ministers is asking it to.
Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners' desire for Chinese food.
However, I cannot accept Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 6 or Amendment No 7, for I consider that they misrepresent the rest of the report.
In the same way I support the rapporteur's proposal on split comitology, whereby decisions on the strategic guidelines would be decided under a management procedure and those on implementation under an advisory procedure.
I am not going to mention the length of this report.

I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.
First, there are ecological advantages and, secondly, there are job opportunities.

Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting

Mr President, you have heard the Commissioner' s request that the vote be delayed, that is, that it should not take place tomorrow.
This may be seen from the JSA' s first annual reports.
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.

If ruminant fat is guaranteed free from proteins, it is also free from dioxins, cinolons etc.
This is a good strategy which will limit the increase in noise pollution, but in my opinion and, I would argue, the opinion of a good number of Members, it will not allow us, in the short term, to reach our objective which is that nobody is exposed to dangerously or uncomfortably high noise levels.
Throughout the ages, mankind has had to consider how to guide scientific developments so as to bring them in line with ethical and social choices.

Of all the speakers, Mrs Diamantopoulou made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism.

What strikes me in the European Union' s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented.

With regard to the case of Austria, we understand that, firstly, the European Parliament' s resolution, which was voted for at the time, is still in force, since no new events have occurred; because it is not a Community issue as such, but has been raised by the fourteen Member States; because, furthermore, my Group supported President Klestil' s appearance and we took good note of his positive proposals, which are in fact related to issues which come within the competence of the Commission - which is not present - such as the application of Article 7 and the strengthening of our community of values.

In essence, this ISO International Standard is the equivalent to the ISO9000 for European companies but with the appropriate environmental slant.
I made a compromise proposal which, unfortunately, was not accepted in my political group.

And if those steps have to be harsh ones, then we should, in full awareness of the facts, not shrink back from taking them.
The rapporteur is pleased with the substantial agreement on the fundamental principles contained in the report, namely that the Community is competent to establish a common methodology for calculating transport costs; that external costs should be included in such evaluations; that revenue should be directed to reducing environmental damage and encouraging modal shift to less polluting transport alternatives; that implementation should be governed by subsidiarity; that the users and polluters pay in proportion to use; and that exemptions should be made for the less mobile members of society and those living in rural areas.
This is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here, Mr President, and I am very pleased to do so.

The fact that the error rate for agricultural expenditure is well below the error rate for the Structural Funds is perhaps due to this financial correction instrument.
If the producer prefers to indicate the country of origin nonetheless, this is possible too.


He has put his finger on the main problems encountered in implementing Structural Funds credits, and he has clearly indicated what we want to see in this area in the future.
I am not asking for a special favour, simply for the application of the procedure applied this morning.
I completely agree with this main message and I also agree with what was said about social cohesion, but I should like to warn against the idea that cohesion of that kind can be created by riding roughshod over the individual countries in an attempt to create uniformity.


Secondly, I consider Paragraph 26 in the Lagendijk report to be a fine idea.

Secondly, the degree to which the Member States were to be involved in the implementation itself was a major issue.


I do not need to add too many explanatory notes.

The new right is getting hold of them and using them to capture the moral high ground.
In some of our countries, we have stockpiles of such meal which we do not yet know how best to destroy, or which has not been destroyed sufficiently, and also animal-based meal used for swine and poultry.




The next item is the report (A5-0210/2000) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on common Community diplomacy 2000/2006(INI).
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.
Thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day.


I am against the demand addressed to political parties that they adopt quota systems and, in particular, the zipper system to set up the electoral lists.
These events are occurring every day, every hour and perhaps every minute.

In terms of civil liability for the environment, it is right that we finally have a White Paper. However, Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago.
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.
We want the Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties precisely because we want the citizens to have more rights and guarantees.

It is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee' s opinion: reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion.
In particular, it stressed the importance of the connection between these two priorities and considered that the common elements of the broad guidelines of economic policy should be fully exploited and the various implementing processes adopted by the Councils over the years coordinated, and by this I am referring to the objectives of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes.



Even more importantly, these words have also become part of everyday language.
On these issues, the European Union gives Europe' s democracies a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.

However, the basic problem here is something quite different.
I hope that, in fact, the timescale will be nine years and not thirteen years, although it pains me to say that, as a Spaniard, I feel restricted by the fact that it has been my government which has insisted most on having this additional period.
This time, however, I would like to state that my vote for the motion is also a call for Mr Bushill-Matthews to accept, at a later date, an amendment which I tabled and which, I regret to say, has been rejected this time.


B5-0160/2000 by Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on freedom of expression in Angola;
It is worth noting that, although the volume of traffic carried by this form of transport has risen over recent years, road transport has fared better, meaning that special attention needs to be given to this more environmentally-friendly form of transport.
The draft basic treaty, presented at our request by the Institute of Florence does, I think, demonstrate the legal feasibility of this exercise.

Clearly, it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs.
We should secure this position and defend it!
hows everyone doing?/

I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment, and that any inflexibility of the system could, in effect, result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries.



If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.


I believe it will do so.
Protection zones must be defined on the basis of scientific studies and the relevant conclusions must be drawn from their results.
We are working on a very tight timescale on this legislation, which is due to come into effect on 1 September.

yes
I am thinking in particular of the problem of allergies.

Some are opposed to the euro, as is their right, while others are attempting to make political capital out of the real concerns which our fellow citizens have regarding the dollar-euro exchange rate.

If, in fact, they cannot comply with what they have agreed to, such countries are doing Green causes harm.

It is true that what happened in 1998 is not the responsibility of this Commission, but I think there has been insufficient willingness to assign responsibility for the mistakes of the past.
This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate.



The broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states.

I feel, however, the question itself contained observations of quite a different kind.
As you will have seen, these two committees attempted to fence in the Commission, so to speak, and place greater restrictions on it, calling upon it to conclude the operation six months earlier and to submit progress reports earlier in the process than proposed.

I think it is excellent that we are trying to adhere to the Rules of Procedure and, on the basis of what was stated by Mrs Lienemann a moment ago, it is quite obvious that there are circumstances which have not been dealt with in committee. With reference to the Rules of Procedure, I would therefore take the liberty of proposing that the matter be postponed and referred back to committee.





The second is the fact that race discrimination is a breach of a fundamental right and European Union law.



The Committee on Budgets therefore suggests that the present proposal with the amounts quoted could be considered as an experiment, a very commendable experiment at that. But a real European Refugee Fund will cost a great deal more than that.


I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.
We have presented proposals on government contracts, postal services and enterprise policy.




There is, without doubt, a great need to clarify the existing differences between the asylum procedure, reception conditions, the interpretation of the definition of a refugee, the links between that asylum procedure and the 'Dublin mechanism' procedures and other forms of protection and, in this respect, this document perfectly focuses the debate.


Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.


Mr President, given the Cartesian evidence that this is not an issue falling within my area of responsibility, I can only say to the Member that I have noted her question and that, as usual, the Commission will certainly give her a direct answer.

Mr Berenguer has also grasped perfectly the line which the Commission intends to take, which is to focus more on economic analysis in developing competition policy, but, at the same time, as Mr Karas, Mr Evans and others have requested, we are endeavouring to provide the greatest possible legal certainty for businesses.


I want to sound a note of caution.
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.


Both the Republic and the North of Ireland seek to continue the derogation agreed in December 1999, because of geographic and geopolitical reasons.




oh, there's a zillion typos waiting to happen there...
So Mr President, let us support exchange programmes so that people can meet one another, understand one another's way of thinking and in the future work alongside one another!
It is surprising that there is no breakthrough in intermodal transport in the offing.
Blackwell: so in ubuntu unstable you get mostly debian sid with ubuntu-ongonig-changes
We know how rapidly the world economy is changing and so we are also aware of the increasing importance of research and development, the value of cooperation between companies, and the need for companies to specialise, and hence also the need for specialisation agreements.

Be in no doubt about that, this legislation would fall.

This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.

The rule of law is necessary.


The sub-committee set up for this purpose has made considerable progress on all issues relating to the refugees, although it has had to postpone, for the time being, the crucial aspect of the right to return.
yep

I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system.
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, it did for me
They may be around 45 at first, but that number may later grow to 60 or even 90.
I will start with the last part of the honourable Member' s question by saying that we were not the ones who gave stature to someone who does not deserve this. It was Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel who did this by agreeing to an alliance with the party of Mr Haider.
Almost 40% of subsidies went to 3% of farmers, and 57% of the beneficiaries received 4.5% of subsidies.

But clarification is also needed for developing vocational training both for learning a trade and for lifelong learning, which should become a right for everyone.
In both cases, spouses and dependent children may accompany the holder of the right of residence and may work.
Even here, the Directorate-General for External Relations is gradually taking charge of the areas that were formerly the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Development, with humanitarian aid compensating for the failures of external policy.
We are all keen to have the results of the evaluations of the remaining countries, one of which is my own country, Portugal, conveyed to us quickly.

Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.
I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents.
I hope that it does just that!


In spite of the number and the importance of these questions, the signature does represent an important event which puts an end to the Arusha process but not to the negotiations as such.

I must admit that the Commission itself attempted to consider this criterion, but we found it extremely hard to come up with a mathematical formula which did justice to the principle of sharing costs and efforts while including this criterion.
I have drawn on many ideas from my fellow delegates, but also from many institutions in the sphere I mentioned above.








It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments.

Allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further.

It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran, where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights. As everyone who has already spoken has said, it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected.

Negligence in work organisation, a lack of appropriate equipment for personal and collective safety, the low level of training and the high number of self-employed workers are the main causes of the high level of injuries and deaths in the workplace.


I fully agree with the honourable Member' s view.
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .
I believe that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is sympathetic to the position of the Committee on Budgets, which I am about to state.
This influence has to be used to encourage the government to take positive steps for re-establishing the rule of law and good governance as a first step towards a more general recovery, and I know this is a point which my colleague, Commissioner Nielson will want to speak about after me.

Such a policy would only be a factor in progress, however, if it were based on an education policy within the various states which aims to earmark greater resources for public education accessible to all.



Allow me to comment briefly on some of the interesting contributions to this debate.
It is that competitive market which will ensure that consumers are protected, not heavy-handed legislation which might stunt e-commerce and leave others around the world to reap the benefits of a revolution in our economy which is unparalleled since the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century.
Now we must work to ensure that a common policy is genuinely achieved in this typical sector, but in order to do so we must respond to those who are complaining - namely the operators - that there is insufficient participation or backing for the choices made, therefore that there is no cooperation in the decision-making process.
I come from a bilingual country myself and I have met some people in that country who never learn the other language, despite the fact that they attend language classes, sometimes for twelve years, and are still unable to speak another language.
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.
This must be done by promoting the active participation of the populations which depend on the forests and the local communities in the creation of policies and planning in the field of development.

In the past year alone, two to three hundred people were killed each month in the most appalling way.
I am totally in favour of this measure, for it is a precise declaration to the Commission that the burden of providing asylum for those who are forced to abandon their own territory, their home, family, friends and all they have in the world must be shared equally between all 15 Member States of the European Union.

is Jane still on holiday?
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.


I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not, however, going to talk about.

I also noted, in the Commission report, in your report, that the initiative engaged the interests of many schools, universities, businesses and associations, not only in the world of education, but also organisations involved in the economy, in combating social exclusion or concerned with rural life.
When companies establish or consolidate a dominant position without proposing the necessary remedies, we have no option but to block a merger and recently did so in a case involving two European companies, Volvo and Scania, which, indeed, are based in the same Member State.

Here the EU is still waiting for a number of G7 countries to play their part.

But the conflict itself is extremely nasty and very problematic for everybody, especially the victims of course.

All those colleagues who are interested in having a drugs policy based on people' s needs will, I hope, do likewise.
Thirdly and finally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the Commission' s opinion on the programme' s target sectors, as well as its wish to see transnational synergies developed. I think the future of the content industry in Europe lies in coproductions.
In view of EMAS' s systematic structure, organisations will clearly be well placed to comply with the environmental legislation.

Mr Sjöstedt, the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty.



If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.
We welcome this report, which is really going to encourage market-opening to the benefit of consumers and the European economy.
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.
We cannot leave them to struggle alone.

My second request to the Council is at long last to incorporate the amendments in Regulation 1408 without any further delays.
I wish to lay particular emphasis on this point, because it has emerged from our exchanges with the European Commission that the latter will not commit itself to the participation of the European Union as such unless it receives a strong and unanimous political signal in favour of participation.

(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on his excellent and important report. The debate caused by this could not have come at a better time.
Let us not forget that the European ports in the Mediterranean face competition from the ports of North Africa, whereas the Baltic or North Sea ports do not face any competition.
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.
I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters.

In conclusion let me say that Mr Wurtz's contribution was very revealing of the constant agenda of the left which aims to separate the European Union from the United States and would result in depriving Europe of any real influence in the world.
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.

And like everyone here in this Parliament, and all European journalists, I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently, nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass.
This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance.

- (FR) This proposed directive is most welcome within the European Union.
And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged, all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports.

If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.
Mr President, it is very regrettable that this common position, which has been put together with such care by the Council and which paid due respect to the Parliament's views at first reading, is now in the process of unravelling.





The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].

That is without even mentioning the pressure exerted on the supporters of the 'Nunca Màs' project who are fighting to keep the memory of these atrocities alive.


It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.

It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned. She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.

I have no doubt that this compromise will help the overall market increase.
In conclusion, let me repeat this expression which you will all recognise as emanating from one of the great founders of the European Union, "If I had to start again, I would start with culture."

Next, of course, is the foreign policy we need to develop and, finally, the third priority is a real European security and defence policy.
Thirdly, if the funding of special envoys is transferred in future to the Council' s administration budget, as is supposed, it will mean that the gentlemen' s agreement between the Council and Parliament will have to be reviewed.
Excluding the Commission from work in this area would be tantamount to accepting the emergence of a fourth pillar in the Treaty, contrary to the Helsinki conclusions.

2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	jlund	That closes the Applications list
With regard to technical requirements, the report mainly deals with two aspects.

Not that I am saying that it is untrue.
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.
But to put an end to Community funding is to spoil what has been achieved.




It is a fact that the whole of the Mediterranean area is frightened about this.
I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs Grossetête' s report.


Indeed no one will deny that means of communication, and in particular the Internet, are most important to the future development of our societies, or that the EU Member States are currently trailing behind the United States in this respect, or that we need to legislate to control the potentially anarchic development of these means in order to limit the excesses to which they can give rise and ensure that they are as successful as possible for our people.



In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.
Immigration, its causes and consequences - which are sometimes terrible and irreparable - business, agricultural and fishing exchanges, social, technical, educational and university exchanges, aspects of common development, such as those in the energy sector, and the essential democratising political aspects which the European Union must promote in those countries all require the creation of new mechanisms and instruments which, in a decentralised fashion, would respond to these needs, which are local but which have widespread repercussions.
Then I pointed out Parliament' s wish to see a strong and independent European Central Bank in the future, one that was well established and had gained the confidence of the market.

Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people.
We must provide all citizens with access to this new information society.

Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals.


Fitness training and sport as a daily exercise and popular sport are in dire straits.
Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia?
In economic terms, understanding was reached on the need to define policies which will enable African countries to gain maximum benefit from the liberalisation of trade throughout the world, thus reversing the current trend of consistently and progressively marginalising Africa in world trade.

It is inconceivable for me that my country is one which criminalises all children of 10 years of age just because they are fingerprinted for their first identity card.
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.
I would suggest that there is a solution. It is already employed widely in the transport sector.
The other two are regarded as safe for all.
So it is a gradual process, but a clearer and faster process than that planned by the Council.
Many congratulations to the honourable Member.




This is a mock-up of how one of these labels will look in future.

They have, as yet, been unable to start the first term of the new school year.

The rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, has the floor.

I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.

It is being done in the consumer's name.

when i setup my Shortcut Keys to pause music when i press ctrl-shift-s, i can't use the "s"-key after that, why is that?
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.
We know there are better long-term solutions because we know our regulation applies only in Europe.

I can inform you that, when we receive visitors in Brussels at the moment, they are admitted and then required to identify themselves. Subsequently, however, their identity cards are collected at reception.
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.

Reports from the UN claim that, every year, more women die from the effects of violence in the home than as a result of traffic accidents, malaria, cancer or war put together.
Some forecast that we will vote against the Treaty of Nice, a perfectly legitimate action, I feel.




In addition, the system of self-evaluation shifts the government's responsibility for the quality of education on to teachers, pupils and parents.
It was a lie, and now we are having to foot a much higher bill.
carlos: time for almuerzo dude
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.
Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus.
Cooperation between Member States is a way to complete these, without independent EU authority, unless the Member States grant a mandate to this effect.
JStrike: Thanks.  I'll take a look.

Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.


Concentrate on these and above all, do so before enlargement.



I, too, Mr Jarzembowski and a few others, would have liked to have seen something more.
These are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being.
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false.
Let it be clear, then, that the much desired level playing field no longer exists.
In return, we can expect African countries to cooperate better at regional level, open up their markets and give their economies a fair chance.

However, these multinationals particularly want to minimise the cost of their raw materials and do not care that this will be at the cost of a change in the composition of chocolate.


i just became aware of the warty/hoary issue 5 minutes ago
Secondly, you said we would have the results by the end of 2001.

However, I cannot resist expressing our delight not only at the concrete steps taken in this area in terms of defence and security but also at the political visibility which this Presidency has had in cooperation with the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commission. It has achieved this by contributing to the resolution of regional conflicts and particularly by ensuring that there is not just one regional conflict mediator available in the world, namely the United States of America, but that Europe can also assume what is one of its main historic vocations and one of the decisive factors in the European project.


It is important that untruths are rapidly rebutted.
We agree with the criticism from the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, that the agreement directly contravenes Article 276 of the Treaty, which guarantees us access to information as part of the discharge procedure.
mako: so, holiday-vacationing, eh?
I am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the IGC before Nice.
Mr President, we have before us two resolutions on fundamental freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo.
A model has been worked out here whereby the costs of cross-border trade are paid into funds.
Small companies often work as subcontractors for our European mammoth organisations, and, as a result, the position of small businesses is more important than ever for competitiveness throughout Europe.
















Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that we have obtained a relatively good hearing for the views we already held at the first reading.

It is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle.




But that was not to be.
In order to take necessary account of the geographical balance to which I referred earlier and to do so in compliance with the essential principle of meritocratic appointment, specific provision is being made.
With regard to the Cairo Summit, it was not included in our initial programme, because when we took over the Presidency, it had not been finalised, but we always said that if the problems could be resolved, we would be prepared to hold the summit.






All the European Union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli.
The Commission' s proposal will lead to our having to deal with the system again before long.


no i dont

The reality is that if you do not get young people into the industry, you will not bring the new ideas in and you will not allow the industry to develop and take on the challenges that it faces in the future, relating not just to the production of food, but to how that food is produced and to ensuring that it is produced in a way the consumer finds acceptable.

I would include this among the priorities I mentioned before, because investments will also be affected if this level of organised crime is maintained.
The last century was marked by three periods.
I have to say that, in France too, the necessary courage is called for to tackle the problem after so many years.
It is not just an issue of whether or not we are using NGOs.

Of course, the education sector is also important and we need huge improvements in education for the children of immigrants and gypsies.

On this occasion, we will not only talk about what we would like to do and what we should do in future, but we will cite examples taken from certain countries as models, but not necessarily at national level.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Secondly, the decision to convert the office in Munich into an EU agency has to be approved unanimously by fifteen governments.
Ethnic tension is once again mounting.
Let me turn now to the fight against doping, which is an absolute priority issue.
they're both pretty much equivalent

Barbarians who in the dead of night carry out monstrous slaughterings, continue to get off scot-free.
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.
Parliament received a letter from Mr Prodi in which he says, on behalf of the Commission, that he has ordered proposals to be made for granting countless African products access to the European market at a zero rate.


First there is the pragmatic deficit.
Subsequently, the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers.
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.



Nonetheless, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein.
As you are aware, Parliament decided this morning to add a communication by Mr Verheugen on enlargement to tomorrow' s agenda at 5.00 p.m.

He certainly did not wish to lose it in a violent manner.


By the same token, how can we ask the former monopolies to now become totally competitive, when they still have major investments to pay off, the product of yesterday' s political choices?


I therefore request that this be orally amended to "biennial" .

It is a voluntary standard which American firms would themselves apply internally and then only with regard to Europeans.

These health and safety policies are the Commission' s first priority in the social agenda.
In fact, it is based closely on the previous framework regulation on the Structural Funds for the programming period 1994-1999.
The Commission puts forward a minimalist directive on the basis of the argument that liberalisation can only be profitable in a context of deregulation. Next the supporters of 'ever more Europe' transpose the directive and go even further (at the start of the year, 65% of the European market had been liberalised although the directive required only 30%!) and, finally, the Commission comes back a second time to 'regularise' the de facto situation in a much more restrictive fashion!
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.


I shall be pleased if we progress by so much as a millimetre.
It is difficult to find common ground at European level.

At a UNESCO meeting some years ago in Casablanca, the issue was raised of whether to make the entire Alpine Region a World Heritage Site.


When we talk about job security and job creation, then we have a very important and crucial directive here which helps us to secure 450,000 jobs a year in Europe.

I still think that even if the scientific data come as late as the year 2004, this information will be very important for us Members of the European Parliament, when we create future legislation in the field of tobacco products.
Certainly it was meant to be.
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.
This motion for urgency tabled by the Council or the presidency is therefore premature and we propose therefore that it be rejected for the time being.
It therefore comes down to the rather unusual process of the text which is actually to be voted on being rejected, but a vote then having to be taken on the legislative resolution.




Amaranth, is that edd dumbill, you talking about?

European citizens must not be kept in ignorance of the fact that the dissemination of these communication technologies is going to destroy jobs as well as create them, and that at the very core of our societies, at macroeconomic as well as at microeconomic level, it presents a challenge to the redistribution of working time and the redistribution of incomes.
This proposal is a step in this direction and I can therefore only give it my support.
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.

In Scotland, the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas.
Through these actions we have targeted institution building, participation in the activities of the European Environment Agency in the region and two environmental hotspots in Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.
Nevertheless, a mishap like this reminds us, despite its trivial nature, of the need to give utmost priority to the constant control and improvement of the procedures in an installation such as the Sellafield reprocessing plant.


Agenda 2000 increased the maximum setting-up grant by 66%, meaning that up to EUR 25 000 can now be paid in aid, and loans to finance setting-up costs qualify for interest rate subsidies.
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.



The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO.

It is absolutely essential to the growth and functioning of e-commerce within the European Union, to strike a reasonable balance between the legitimate concerns of the consumer and those companies that want to use the Internet for e-commerce purposes.

A Parliament in which the ceiling of four seats per Member State, which does not allow for a balanced representation of the political forces, is unacceptable.


I have to say that the British Labour Members will vote against the exclusion of waste incineration from the definition of renewables, on the understanding that this refers to material which cannot be recycled.
Europe must give consumers back their confidence, as they have been avoiding beef since the mad cow scandal.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of course shares the view that it is important to ensure a wide exchange of views and information and maintain consultation between the institutions of the European Union.
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.

However, we also need to conduct further discussions with the incoming administration in the United States because the United States is traditionally the proposer and has been so where this resolution is concerned.
Now traditionally fallen stock has been disposed of by burial on the farm, but with these very large units this is just not a practical way of disposal, so many of the units have installed their own incinerators - small incinerators using less than 50 kg per hour.

Finally, I would like to highlight the health aspect.
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.
We agree with the principles enumerated by Commissioner Diamantopoulou at the end of this morning's debate.

He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions.
I will end, Mr President, with the following quote: "We must be rebels, but we must also be competent" .

Secondly, I have just returned from a visit by the European Parliament delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council and I would like to encourage all of those who are able to do so to go to Palestine, to go to Gaza and the West Bank, to go there, to have meetings, to look people in the eye and listen.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
No to a new regulatory structure - after all, the current system effectively organises, particularly with regard to safety, a balanced flow of traffic while respecting the national systems which all states are entitled to. No to the Commission representing the Member States with regard to external States, thereby destroying any political decision-making power in the field of air transport.

Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.







Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for getting the report to this stage.

First of all, I wanted to vote against Amendment No 11.

Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.
We also tabled a proposal intended to protect the Portuguese brand 'Português Suave' as we consider that there is no reason to threaten this.
But before we embark on such a radical decision, we should look at the history, particularly in the United States, of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF.
Peat has its own part to play in forest-based industries, particularly in the Nordic countries and in Ireland.
However, this is not what the text does. On the contrary, it asks the Portuguese Presidency to do this.
We hope that it will be possible to maintain this support in future, and we also hope that this can be totally reconciled with the new WTO rules, especially in the new round which we hope will start sooner or later.
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.

The European Central Bank cannot put forward amendments here, and it is a slight on all delegates who have submitted amendments to say that they have raised these issues and put forward these amendments (which, incidentally, were all adopted unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs) on behalf of third parties, and not on the basis of their own judgement and responsibility, simply because the report has been adopted unanimously together with the amendments.
My only regret is that attendance is low, but it is nevertheless of an extremely high calibre.

The reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services.
I like cold weather


Unfortunately, they are for real. What is more, Fiji is an ACP country which enjoys considerable benefits thanks to the sugar protocol with the European Union.
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.
Some of us newcomers to this Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions, fantastic programmes and of hearing about the spirit of the Community regulations.
Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June.
I am very sorry, Mrs Read, but I cannot allow you to speak again, as we are already running late.

If we oblige our committee to address the individual programme points, there will be considerably less time and energy for tackling the efficiency of the programme as a whole.
I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report.
We cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes, and, for this reason, we voted against the report.
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.
at 1024x768 there is some wierd blurring of things
We make a point of getting in contact with all players in a very visible and clear way.

Subject: Restoring normal relations with Austria In view of the response given earlier in the year by the Council to the recent political developments in Austria and of the need to promote the best overall interests of the European Community, will the Council now state if it is prepared to restore normal relations with Austria at every level?
The sanctions on Iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there.




Thirdly, what capacity do the Member States have for destroying the materials that are now being removed?


We welcome incidentally the formation of a European research area which you and Commissioner Busquin have put forward.
As regards the other points, I am not in a position to comment in detail on the judicial or legal situation in Austria, but I know that there are other countries which appear to have a far more enviable political situation.
Many of the atrocities in the Balkans that we spoke of earlier and much of the racism and antisemitism is because communities everywhere have not been allowed the ability, in line with the concept of subsidiarity, to develop within their own communities the democracy that people need everywhere if they are to evolve and create within their own regions and nations, the social rights, justice, respect for minorities, coexistence of different people and respect for every race and people.

The human genome and its sequences should not be patentable.


The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.
But fat is still being added, albeit heat-treated fat.


Safety measures are not the only things that cost.

Mr President, the question I am dying to ask is this: to what extent do the Member States themselves actually share the rapporteur' s views?
In such circumstances, indeed, why should we hold back?
That is why, as I have been doing for years, we must expose the shortcomings of the common agricultural policy, which has tended to favour large-scale farmers while overlooking the real world of the small farmers who are the lifeblood of our countryside.
Democracy depends upon decision-making by the people, not upon manipulation by the institutional machine.


As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.


Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.
no i didnt see nothing
Madam President, the resolution on North Korea, on which Parliament is about to vote, has a political significance of the first water.
As the new millennium dawns, we are continuing to fight alongside our colleague Mrs Karamanou, who I would like to thank sincerely for her persistence and hard work, in order to move closer to the objective of equality in the distribution of power between men and women.

lostmonk,  thats in ubuntu

Gxine is good as well.
I should also like to inform you that, as far as the few amendments tabled are concerned, I essentially endorse all of them, with the exception of Amendment No 3, with regard to which I am somewhat perplexed by the reference to State aid.

It should be further developed and deepened.
A specific analysis of the friction costs allied to intermodal freight transport reveals that the main drawbacks compared to traditional unimodal transport can be identified as high costs, longer time frames, inferior quality, higher risks of damage to goods, restrictions as to the types of goods that can be transported, and more complex administrative procedures.
. (FR) The compromise that came out of the conciliation procedure, the final legislative stage, is the result of hard negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Mr President, our foodstuffs - and this also applies to entirely fresh produce, for example the peeled carrots we heard mentioned today - are nowadays doctored in all kinds of ways with colouring agents, sweeteners, flavour enhancers and preservatives, in fact with every possible type of substance. And all in order to disguise the products' natural characteristics.
For this reason, it is of course most important for us, for my group, to see how seriously you take Parliament, how you deal with our proposals and, in the final analysis, we hope that we will continue to be able to report gladly and proudly on how well we are cooperating together.



This is proof, for those who might still have doubts, that we must not negotiate with the far right, as every small victory it achieves strengthens it and makes it more commonplace.

It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.

We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying - not mystifying - the work of Parliament, by reducing jargon, by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual.


At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.
Today, we have proved that we stand for this, and that is how it should be.
I very much hope that this debate on Paraguay today in this house, here in Strasbourg, will be viewed not just as a sign of European solidarity, but also as a sign that Europe takes its responsibilities seriously!







Politics involves repeating oneself and contradicting oneself.




Surely, when we are looking at budgetary rigour we have the right to address this issue because until we do so the general public will be confused about what we are doing in so many places.
They need to familiarise themselves with the Internet and data bases from an early age.
If there had been a check with cards, maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count.
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.

That is just the problem with this issue.
Will there be a floppy netinstall image for ubuntu ?

First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.

That is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices.
It is absolutely right - as has been stated here - that the price package is no longer as significant as it was in the past.



However, should they fail in their endeavours then, at the second reading stage, Parliament, through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, will act and legislate in this area.
In Helsinki in December 1999 the European Council decided that, on a half-yearly basis, the General Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council should hold public debates on the Council's work programme.
The second reason is that we have to, in this increasingly homogenised era of global audio-visual content, get into the area of freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of diversity.
I therefore feel that it could well be appropriate to set rather more refined benchmarks for the cohesion policy and I continue to call for the implementation of the project to enlarge Europe to provide us with less rigid objectives and establish a more flexible scale, rather than necessarily tying us to this idea of a totally automatic process, which sends the regions flying from category to category.
With regard to defining the pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership, Turkey' s problems will certainly be paid close attention, particularly in terms of respect for the basic criteria of acting in accordance with European standards.

crimsun: powerbook.. onboard sound.. worked fine before..
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.
My final point concerns the lack of a Community patent.
On the one hand, what they say seems reasonable; it seems reasonable to establish bilateral policies between the European Union and some of the countries in which the problem of the exodus of migrants and refugees is greatest; this seems useful.

A Union of 25 to 30 Member States cannot operate in the same way as a Union of 15 Member States. Instead, we need both an overview of the institutions' working methods and a clearer distribution of labour between the Member States and the EU.

Our Group accepts this common position and can support it as it stands.




linux_mafia, I'm trying to figure out how to "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
They would throw them into the village pond.
The European Treaties assign specific tasks to the Court of Auditors and to the European Court of Justice respectively. The Court of Auditors is responsible for the external control of finances and it is the role of the Court of Justice to oversee the disciplinary procedures pursued by the Commission should the need arise.

It has brought about rapid advances in technology, which, at the end of the day, will lead to an increase in jobs, even high-quality jobs in the major sectors.
Be that as it may, the first steps have been taken and they should be followed through, because I also believe that what we have in the text here can, should and, indeed, ought to be put into effect sooner than we have agreed, which for me is the minimum.

The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.



Mr President, now we have heard words of praise, we Greens, but we have also been attacked slightly.

The next item is the report (A5-0184/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2001 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council's first reading.
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.

Now, I see that the Commissioner is not listening. Perhaps he does not have time to do that, either.

Furthermore, we ask that, as soon as possible, flat rates be established for access to the Internet, to the network of networks, and we even argue that they should be free, since they should be offered, like health and education, as an essential public service to the citizens.
It would not be advisable to additionally define the individual options until these discussions have been concluded.

I appeal to the Commissioner to make our humanitarian aid the number one political priority - the Caucasian region has been a priority for the USA and for Russia for a long time. I say this because I have the feeling that the European Union, apart from Mrs Schleicher, who is doing marvellous work, is failing to take up this challenge.
In the banana case, for example, we have not so far been able to reconcile the interests of our producers, those in the ACP countries, with the demands of the WTO.

In the same way, we must look at conflict prevention and crisis management in the context of our new European security policy.
Mr Wurtz, you know very well that Brussels is not the only place, and I smile when I say this, where politicians of right or left meet employers.

We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.

One is that by 2002, all of Europe' s schools and training centres should be connected to the Internet and that they should at the same time have appropriately trained staff to provide the training which young people leaving secondary education need. I also would also like to see everyone receiving professional training, whether they are unemployed or not, to be able to gain a kind of "driving licence" for the information society, which will enable them to operate computers and navigate the Internet.


Mr Bowis, I note your concerns and we will certainly convey these to the Member States. However, I must say that the European Union has not ignored the issue of Tibet.

In the Basque Country we need less fascism from ETA and less centralism and imposition from the state; we need more dialogue, more democracy and more respect for the democratic decisions of the Basque parliament.
However, this report, although probably inspired by the best intentions, occasionally takes a direction which I feel is highly dangerous in that it tends to erase notions of citizenship and legality and turns a multiplicity of exceptions into the common law on which the Community approach is based.

The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgetary Control are not holding the present Commission per se responsible for the deplorable state of affairs in previous years.

Mr President, I too should like to thank the Portuguese President for his answer, and I would also ask him to confirm that there is no question of an issue being taken off the agenda for any meeting of Ecofin because it has already been discussed in a Euro 11 meeting.


Pozac: ok
At the time they were still finding it very difficult to build on their various contacts here.

As early as the beginning of April of this year, a campaign was begun to make travellers aware of what is happening.

Nor will we accept the amendment which implies a rejection of the joint text - Amendment No 26 - which contradicts the other approaches.
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.


We are thinking, obviously, of the reform underway within the Commission, but also and perhaps more importantly, within the Council.

It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.



The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.

They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise. They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy.
Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden.
Apparently, Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity.
As a result, a lot of things work well within our countries.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.


We must fight against discrimination and psychological and other forms of abuse in the spheres of work, information, politics and the family, which is again at the centre of the debate at a time when children are being transformed into mere objects to satisfy the egotism of those who, having relinquished all other values, are attempting to satisfy their egos and their desire to possess with "technological" motherhood or fatherhood.
I consider fixing the quotas for ten years to be a step in the wrong direction, and I believe that the Commission was already going the right way before this.
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.

I have therefore asked permission to prepare an own-initiative report so that we can have these issues clarified.
If the Union only deals with civil and police matters whilst the governments' exclusive remit is military aspects, then the unity of European action is in danger of becoming the first casualty in crisis situations.

In the 1950s, the existence of the forerunners of the European Union was justified in terms of voluntary cooperation between European states and peoples in order to regulate a number of cross-border issues of mutual interest.

"If only they had!" I replied.

This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations.




It is not enough to denounce the crooks that make money by trafficking in human beings.

At every opportunity and at various levels, the European Union has reminded Egypt of its concern about the human rights situation and about the need for Egypt to respect fundamental freedoms, particularly given its status as a member of the EU-Mediterranean partnership.

The Spanish journalist, Carlos Herrera, is a symbol of all those victims, Madam President, and I would like to ask you, on behalf of the European Parliament, to convey to him our feeling of solidarity, because this solidarity expresses the unquestionable defence of freedom of expression that we, as democrats, are obliged to make.

Finally, this draft budget remains totally in keeping with the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to be able to say that I am glad to hear this.

Mr President, the Council is clearly concerned about the internal conflicts in Georgia which still need to be resolved. It is also concerned about the difficulties which are being experienced in terms of consolidating democracy and improving the standard of living of the people of that country.
This is unacceptable in my view.

There is never anybody from the air traffic controllers in the airport to turn around and say that is not true.
However, some of us are tired of waiting for this horizontal regulation in which the Commission has been engrossed for some 10 years now, and we want to move forward.



I know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but, without a doubt, in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success.
Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union, it is a relatively small amount of money.
The European Union was right to condemn this policy, all be it a little belatedly.
Secondly, I welcome your wish to strengthen coordination between the Community and the Member States in international forums and at international conferences.
I must point out that the United States have at least 25 years of experience in this type of system, which supports the idea that this can work and that it is going to work.

The Charter is required for the purpose of providing the Union' s present and future citizens with constitutional guarantees.

This is understandable, because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave, with adverse effects on employment.
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.

Our overall vote cannot, however, be taken as implying that we support the desire for an extended agenda at the Intergovernmental Conference and the legally binding incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty. In this connection, we would refer to our explanations of vote on these matters, issued in connection with the Helsinki Summit, the calling of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament' s position on the Intergovernmental Conference and preparations for the Feira Summit.




By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.




no, we can't

We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.

I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.

Of the six named phthalates to be banned as a result, two are used for flooring and cosmetics but not for children's toys, one is not used at all, one is not made at all, one is not used because of fears it might be carcinogenic (though on 8 February it was totally cleared by the WHO) and that leaves one, DINP that is used to soften PVC in chewing rings and so on.

That is an important observation that cannot be repeated often enough.

Mrs Schroedter or Mr Markov have noted disparities that are still unacceptable.
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.

The Commission relies on the Member States for the collation of this data.
Everyone realises, or will realise, the importance of the European Parliament in the budgetary process and how important it is to achieve consensus in this process.
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?
But those who are building Europe seem unaware of that fact: they not only want to bring happiness to the people ex nihilo, regardless of their differences and their aspirations, but, on top of that, they want to establish a society without points of reference, without distinction between what can and cannot be done, a society that believes in hedonism or the culture of death.

Therefore, Mrs Jackson, what the Financial Times said is not true at all.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is gratifying and encouraging to hear this House speak of a new strategic objective for the next decade.

What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations, rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects?

Let me make one more point before concluding, Madam President.
Therefore, given that the Commission' s proposal is basically the same as the one to which we gave our assent in March 1999, given that the amount of money stipulated is exactly the same and given that the proposal has precise objectives, I, as rapporteur, feel that Parliament should deliver a favourable opinion on this proposal.

Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.


That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.
But while Mr Hannan is here in the Chamber this morning, perhaps he could give us a guarantee that he will be making a new entry in his declaration of financial interests to say where the money has come from.


that's... odd.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.


The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures, many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses.

However, we would like to see the contradictory procedure shortened for the agencies.
I have to say I do not know what conclusion to draw because it is clear from the vote that, in fact, after making that promise the vast majority of the PPE actually voted against the resolution.
By remaining attentive to the threats affecting the people, and by making it possible to recognise a right of asylum, solid bridges may be built between the two sides of the Mediterranean.
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.

In 1997, the closure of one Renault factory near Brussels employing 3 200 people focused public attention on the negative consequences of industrial change.

We have already overrun by 45 minutes.
It is Europe' s duty to pass stringent legislation that will make these alchemists accountable and to guarantee product quality whilst also providing citizens with clear information.
So I hope that the House will accept this logic and vote for Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
But, nonetheless, a dialogue which refutes the current logic on which the Intergovernmental Conference functions and, at the end of the day, a dialogue between France and Germany.

Women are universally under-represented where decisions are made.
They received a standard letter from our local social security office asking them to attend for a two-hour interview and to bring with them as many items as possible on a non-exhaustive list of about twenty documents such as a passport, bank statements, or household bills to "establish their identity".
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.
There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels.


The agreement applies to buildings and Council staff but not necessarily to seconded military personnel, whose salary comes from their own Member State.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.

My conclusion is that I should ideally like to see the old arrangement maintained, with different rules in different countries.



It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.


This principle in essence means that safety and health must be put before any conflicting scientific evidence, and I fully support the previous speakers who again referred to the importance of applying the precautionary principle.
There are, however, also many more examples.
oh okay. ;)



But we can be pleased with the outcome.
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.

That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.
Madam President, that makes perfect sense to me, given that you have already promised to make inquiries in your famously discreet manner, and we are not going to entertain the idea of having a debate and a resolution on urgent subjects just because of some cock-and-bull stories.

The question was also raised of women' s appointments.
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.
I would also like to say to him that, beyond the observations, criticisms and proposals addressed to me as the new Commissioner for Regional Policy, a post which I have held for quite a few months now, this reading is also extremely useful for the future.

For my country, Ireland, food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers.
Mr President, my assessment is a rather critical one.
I think it is fair to say that this has so far been successful and that we intend to continue in this spirit.

Two examples of that would be hair-dryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre.
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.
I do recognise, however, that the lack of harmonisation of this concept at European level and especially the Commission' s intention to submit a directive on temporary and subsidiary protection to Parliament and the Council next year will allow us to deal with the right to family reunification in that directive very soon.


In view of these considerations and given that the cornerstone of a people' s Europe is the fundamental commitment to freedom, pluralism and human rights, what view does the Council take of such a measure and will it intercede with the competent Greek authorities to put an end to the persecution of the author and the ban on his book?

Mr President, I will not actually speak for very long, but, so far, if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, only those in favour of the process have been allowed to speak.



But they must be persevered with and the past, in other words what was done to these minorities by the occupying forces, must be overcome so that a new common future can be built in the Baltic states together with the Russian-speaking minorities.

However, my impression after a few months in this job is that Parliament wants as badly as the Commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world.

Because the joint motion for a resolution refuses to acknowledge the correlation between cases of cancer and leukaemia in soldiers who served in the occupying forces in Bosnia and Kosovo and during the Gulf War and depleted uranium, it confines itself to a wish list of transparent discussions and working parties and merely calls for the Member States who are members of ÍÁÔÏ to propose that the use of depleted uranium weapons be stopped and for ÍÁÔÏ to study the possibility of using different types of weapons, in other words to continue killing, but with "clean" weapons.
Even the Committee on Budgetary Control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of European Union aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.

Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.
As I said before, Mr Nogueira, a person may choose which side of the fence to sit on, but he later cannot seek futile excuses to justify his decision.
It goes without saying that future regulations which become Community law in the European Union will not be affected by this framework agreement.
As far as treatment is concerned, I believe it is important for the pharmaceutical industry to find affordable alternatives to the medication which is of some help in our Western countries, also where transmission of the illness from mother to child is concerned.

Greece is welcome in euroland, and all Member States in the euro zone must respect the letter and spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact.

Mr President, I voted for the MEDIA report but I feel that, since pensioners and the elderly watch television more than anyone else and are therefore extremely interested in this European Union aid, it would be beneficial if they were able to watch a European television channel broadcasting European programmes.


I should therefore like to say that today' s vote has been very important.

By adopting a system of environmental management, companies - whether they be industrial or service companies - learn to integrate environmental considerations into the normal management of the company, discovering the many and significant advantages, not only environmental but also economic, which this offers them, amongst other things, because they improve their competitive position.


Why is a German pensioner, who is undergoing dialysis, only permitted to have access to this for a limited period of time when holidaying in France?

Genuine cooperation on an equal footing can only be established between Europe and Africa if they are no longer in thrall to industrial and banking groups that grow rich on exploiting the working classes of the two continents.



The proposed changes will readjust our system of accounting to the new policies that have been devised.
I would urge the Commission to go further by financing immigrants' micro-projects.
I therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here.
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal.

Pessimism, finally, because Europe remains too divided on this point, with too many states, particularly northern European states, preferring the Atlantic connection to the Euro-Arab or Euro-African connection, as evidenced by the gradual abandonment of the Lomé policy and the weakness of our Mediterranean policy.
But allow me to say clearly that I am wholeheartedly in favour of establishing the principle of humanitarian access in all situations and of reinforcing the right of those in distress to receive humanitarian aid.


A second point is a premium scheme for the use of nets, which restricts additional catches. This is a truly technological improvement.



Therefore, taking on that responsibility, we are in support of the European Parliament addressing the Government of Sierra Leone today and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the British soldiers who have been taken hostage.
I would like to direct my second point to Parliament itself.
I consider this to be very encouraging news.
Proceeding on the basis that there will be "5+1 countries" in the first round of negotiations - a lot can obviously happen during the next few years, but these six countries nonetheless have a two-year head start in terms of the negotiations - this means that five new official languages will be added to the eleven we already have at present.
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.
In my opinion, we will need to establish in time within the European Union that Feira has been a historic opportunity to solve this issue.


The ECB has recently justified keeping tight control of its key interest rates by referring to the inflationary pressure created by the increase in oil prices and in rates of exchange.






I am sure there is a shared opinion across this House of how important small businesses are.

On the road towards this, a pre-accession strategy must be established between the Commission, on the EU' s behalf, and Turkey. The preparation of this strategy involves non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the Turkish Government.
Normal didn't work
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.

If they had, the House would have voted unanimously in favour of this human rights report because, apart from that, Mr Haarder has presented an exemplary piece of work.
The audiovisual sector basically faces the task of having to develop in two main fields.
Yet the distances travelled on average have been increasing since as early as 1970, a trend which favours the use of more than one mode of transport.

(EL) Neither the letter, i.e. the legal basis, nor, more importantly, the spirit of the way in which the burgeoning e-commerce industry is developing and the speed with which it is spreading augur well for the protection of citizens' personal data and privacy; on the contrary, they give cause for serious, widespread concern as regards both the decimation and restructuring of commerce and the market itself and the intensification of efforts to abolish civil rights, make citizens slaves to technology and the savage laws of the capitalist market and turn their personal lives and their very existence into cheap, malleable raw materials to generate profits.



It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .
This is where the presidency, with the Commission and, I am sure, with Parliament' s support, will be concentrating its efforts in the weeks and months to come.
I should add that ADNS regions are too small and too difficult to control.

The Socialist Group accepted this proposal, which is why we, together with the Liberal Group, abstained from voting today on all of the amendments that do not refer to this new consultation.

We can but express our wholehearted condemnation of terrorism and particularly at a time when the terrorists seem so intent on destroying us.


The Belder report contains a few concrete pointers in this respect.
The e-learning initiative, which I launched in May of last year, relates to the infrastructure of the education system, because any future action in that field depends on a sound educational infrastructure.
- (EL) Ladies and gentlemen, the Pomés Ruiz report has the good fortune to assess the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes at a time when the economic climate has helped these programme achieve success.
We do not have the right to mislead the consumer by using the name 'chocolate' to designate products which are not necessarily made from cocoa.



Let me give you another example. Although unemployment is rising in Germany' s five new Länder, money is once again being invested in roads instead of jobs in the new Community support framework.
On the theme of violence, too little attention is being paid to violence within the family, in my opinion.


Mr President, I must apologise for my absence earlier. I had notified the services that I would be temporarily unavailable.
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?
As regards the decision-making procedure in the European Parliament, there is broad consensus that no revision of the Treaty should be effected which involves changing the existing institutional balance.


May I state clearly for the record here that BSE owes a great deal to government failings, to gross negligence in the United Kingdom and to multiple acts of negligence on the part of the Commission up to 1996 - I can honestly say that I know of no-one who got it right in the fight against BSE.

Among the issues closest to people' s hearts, one of the most important nowadays is that of food safety.


The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye.

anir, what if you have only a windows cd a unplugged computer?
Therefore, I emphatically support Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which provide for us to make the transposition of environmental protection measures following assessment a little more binding in nature.
This morning in this House we were witness to one of its most repulsive forms, when the age-old assertion that the Jews themselves are responsible for antisemitism was repeated.
It appears from our programming discussions with the South African Government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the Member States.

More and more, we need to follow our words with actions.
The European Union is granting different forms of economic aid to different countries.
Mr President, contrary to popular belief and notwithstanding the debate that has taken place here this morning, this directive is not about defining the concept of family, which is generally binding throughout the European Union.

In the recent past, we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998.






Trafficking in human beings is, after drugs and weapons, the third largest source of income for organised crime.



I would simply point out to the House that, in the criminal proceedings that led the French government - wrongly, in my opinion, but that is not the issue here - to withdraw Mr Le Pen' s mandate, in contravention of the French Penal Code, the courts made no request for Mr Le Pen' s immunity to be withdrawn.

It is important, and I thank her for it.
Did the governments and the military know?

Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.


I am convinced that this can contribute to a renaissance for goods transport in the Community.




Questions Nos 53 to 60 will be replied to in writing.

Mrs McKenna, I must tell you that with regard to trans-European networks right now priority is being given de facto to rail projects, if that is what you are concerned about.
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.
Finally, the candidate, Mr Toledo, during his visit to various countries of the European Union and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (incidentally, it would have been desirable for him to have met with Members of this Parliament during his visit to Brussels), expressed on several occasions the importance of preserving and maintaining economic cooperation and aid from the European Union to the Peruvian people.

Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.

In another 12 proposed amendments I can see what your concerns are but the Commission is unable to accept these amendments.


As a believer in subsidiarity, I remain convinced that the most effective way to achieve this result is through the development of a network of cooperation with these Ombudsmen as similar bodies such as petitions committees.
The new Amsterdam situation means that when we pass amendments and resolutions in this Chamber we have to be more aware of the legal consequences as well as the political consequences of what we are deciding.
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	morning



I feel that this amendment is based on a point which brings the citizens much closer to Europe and the European Union: the citizens who are called on to vote realise that the candidates are the same throughout the 15 States, and this would show them that Europe does exist and that there is a reason for its existence.

Some of those challenges will be very difficult to overcome, but the important thing is that we have to turn the rhetoric of what we have been saying for many, many years - about full employment, about a socially inclusive society, about a society that is based on innovation and knowledge - into reality.
Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars.

I am particularly pleased, too, that Mr Duisenberg has reiterated his promise to publish forecasts and econometric models, and I entirely understand his caveats.

The committee has, as the Commission will be well aware, grappled long and hard with the issues raised in Articles 15 and 17 of the proposed regulation.
The evidence that I can give you is that there has been no delay in the last six months.
We must be aware that the whole Conference is set out according to the decisions taken in Amsterdam.

It is not just UNITA which is to blame. The government too is responsible for this continuing violence.
The Commission cannot, therefore, approve Amendments 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33 (1), 34, 35, 37, 41, 42, 47, 48, 49 and 50.
The key provisions - Art. 9, paragraph 4 - state that a Member State "shall not be in breach of this Directive" if a decision not to introduce domestic water charges based on "established practice does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive".

The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.

We cannot afford to be overtaken by events any longer.
We should drive through the liberalisation of the telecoms package, because it is only with a low-cost competitive telecoms market that we can deliver this power, these low prices and these big opportunities to our consumers, because that is the only way to get low prices for our consumers.
Needless to say, Parliament needs to keep a critical eye on the Commission.

The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done, and this is something we have discussed at length.
Finally, we do not support Amendment No 5 as the term 'serious doubts' is considered to be too subjective, making it very difficult to implement the regulation.
Parliament is keen that we should produce readable texts.
So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years.
I am also totally opposed to the way in which the Greek government has achieved our accession to EMU, pursuing nominal rather than de facto convergence, making Greece one of the countries of the Union with the highest rates of unemployment and continually selling off the state' s assets in order to cover treasury deficits.

In addition, we disbursed a EUR 27.5 million special cash facility in the belief that it was in the interest of both sides not to undermine the Palestinian Authority' s ability to pay salaries.
hmm, no lilo in the base system atm



This common position was sent to the European Parliament for second reading at the July 2000 part-session.
It is, in effect, appropriate for them to be able to rest in-between operations, particularly during their training period, also in consideration of the fact that, during the rest of their careers, it is above all - not exclusively, but for the most part - the elderly who will fall victim to their scalpels.
Secondly: how will our working life and employment relations change?
If these are to be included, this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency.


It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas.

We should keep thinking about the future of the transport sector and aviation, in particular.

Apart from that, it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions.
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.



Experience has taught us that things can go very far wrong depending on how food is distributed, and it could well end up sitting in the warehouses.

Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.





I regret the fact that there was such little consultation with the Union' s Member States and the European Parliament which are, in the main, supporters not of the fine cause that is the World Trade Organisation, of which we too are part, but of that of the frantic development of global free-trade, to the detriment of our people' s essential interests.
The European Union nevertheless considered it important that elections should be held and that the results should be credible and acceptable.

2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	mike998	partition magic springs to mind
I read here that the euro is an 'essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration' .
In the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published.




Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.
In fact, there was no such risk. Existing European legislation governing the equal treatment of men and women only pertains to the sphere of work and is still lacking in many other areas which, especially if we compare it to the directive which we are discussing today with regard to racial discrimination, need attention as a matter of urgency.

That statement could not be much clearer.
But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work.
Mr President, it is possible to keep track of the Council' s work by means of the monthly reports prepared by the General Secretariat of the Council and which are published on the Council' s web site, covering legislative and non-legislative acts approved since January 1999 and including the results of votes, explanations of vote and statements for the minutes when the Council is acting in its legislative capacity.
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .



In the space of 24 hours, you are going to approve a financial package of tens of millions of euros for Turkey and condemn this self-same country for bombing the Kurdish populations of northern Iraq, in violation of another country' s airspace.
The demand for repatriation of the 3.7 million migrants will definitely not make the peace talks easier, nor will the distribution by the Palestinian authorities of schoolbooks which, instead of preaching the language of reconciliation, preach the language of hatred and animosity, or Arafat' s tough stance in Davos, for that matter.
Serbia, poised to tip the scales of stability in South-Eastern Europe, has been thrust into that fourth Europe by its aggressive national political elite, which has, from time to time, been supported by the nationalist ambitions of political elites from other Balkan nations.



Once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all.

The best way to establish these vertical rules is via collective labour agreements, but if these collective labour agreements are not forthcoming, then the Commission will need to take the initiative and propose draft directives.
What is really lacking is a credible desire to assume greater global responsibility in the realms of mediation and crisis management.
I have already, on many occasions, bemoaned the fact here in plenary that Parliament' s television system fails to produce a picture for Finnish television.
This note was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu, a developing country in the Pacific.
Yes, they are considering it; yes, they have had several annual reports about the protection of personal data.


We must therefore ban toys and objects containing phthalates which are likely to be put either totally or partially into children' s mouths.
Mr President, Commissioner, my colleague, Mrs Thyssen has produced some excellent work and I wish to congratulate her on it.

Mr President, Commissioner, the crisis in the Philippines we are discussing is a tragedy.
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.
And it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the European Union.
In this regard, and before making any decisions - and this is one of the key points of our resolution -, we should, Commissioner, send a high level European Union mission which could, after meeting with all the political forces and with representatives of civil society, make an assessment of the situation on the ground in the light of the democratic clause, which is an essential element of the agreement between the European Union and Peru.
How great is the damage which has already been caused to the European economy?
That is also mentioned in the report.





We need an education system that can easily adapt to rapid developments in modern society.
In short, the draft amendment to the directive is intended to ensure the introduction of separate accounting procedures for specific types of firms.
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.
This means information and propaganda from above.
Of course, we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications.

We should not be deceived by the painless transition on 1 January 1999.
I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for an excellent exposition of the rapid reaction facility.
Our task is to ensure that following on from this, the Commission' s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives.
We are on the brink of an historic occasion where the risks are great, but so are the opportunities.

There are, nevertheless, a number of warning signs, but these are not of a nature to stop us proceeding with a development policy as we had intended and planned to do.
That is why I now ask you: do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas?
Indeed, it is a great shame, and I hope that Mrs Villiers will come back some time and perhaps pay a visit to our committee so she can hear some of the debate about this report as well - because I noticed that she disappeared soon after she made her point - maybe we will read about that in the papers as well.



A year on there is no directive.
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.
We urgently need to implement the Tampere conclusions and devise a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on European humanitarian values and respect for fundamental human rights.


For the work of the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon to be effective, Member States have to cooperate fully.


To whomever follows up this part of our policy in the future, I propose extending the regulations which allow cumulative work periods to count towards a pension to all workers from countries of the southern borders of the Mediterranean. These regulations should thus be extended from European Union States to countries on the other side of the Mediterranean.

It is my hope that we can pass this report without any substantial amendment other than procedural ones because the report is an extension for one year of an existing regulation which supports four million refugees in the most war-torn and ravaged part of the world.
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.
These are issues that the Romanian authorities say they are taking very seriously and, as far as I could ascertain, they consider that they stem from a cultural situation affecting certain sections of the population.

In sum, I would like to say that we will undoubtedly continue to discuss the nuts and bolts but as far as the main points are concerned, I do consider Mr García-Margallo y Marfil' s report as welcome confirmation of the Commission' s vision.
Does the Council have any strategy for this sensitive region?
As far as the PCB [polychlorinated biphenol] directive is concerned, we should also turn our attention to the supplies.
yes terminal

If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.






They are only to be found in English.

Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU, although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated, which is done only in the United States.
I thank the Member for her supplementary question.
Furthermore, the Commission considers that the post-2002 review of the CAP, which was, as you know, agreed in the Berlin European Council conclusions, will provide a basis for further savings.

In other words, extending the system to asylum seekers automatically identifies refugees and immigrants as a whole with crime and illegality, which I think is quite unfair and goes beyond every concept of international law and respect for human rights as demanded in the Geneva Convention, the 50th anniversary of which we celebrated in this morning' s extended debate here in the European Parliament.
The common position offers an adequate level of safety for both man and the environment, which is why the PPE is against tightening up the common position, especially in certain critical areas.

The Commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive.

On this continent, of all places, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost, we have to insist that today' s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State.



EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.



At the same time, however, this means that we must confine ourselves to the traditional fundamental rights and avoid extending the scope to social and economic fundamental rights, which are not legally enforceable at European level.
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.



At Bergamo Orio al Serio airport, as I was leaving to come to Strasbourg, I met a pensioner - a very old lady who is 80 years old - who told me that she wanted to go to Paris to visit her daughter but that she could not do so because she would lose her Italian State pension which is her only means of support.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0001/2001).

The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes.

To make it very clear also to Mrs Isler Beguin that means that what was written in the common letter by Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wulf-Mathies is still valid.

By way of preparing for the report, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities organised a public hearing which involved experts and the presence of a victim who came to give her story.
Hence, a thorny issue, such as the right to return of the Palestinian refugees, could have been presented by the Palestinian Authority to its own constituents as an issue involving sensitive details which had to be dealt with in conjunction with the Israeli Government on the proviso, of course, that that government agreed, in time, to Palestinian demands that were easier to accept.
In the first three years of the transition period, the number of weekly working hours shall not exceed 58, or 56 during the last two years.
Firstly, Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights.

So what is it for and who is it against, if not to allow the great powers of Europe to be able to continue, on behalf of the European Union as a whole, their Community political game in Africa, the West Indies or elsewhere?



It must aim to promote quality food which is part of a more general philosophy of quality of life!

Many people back in Austria ask me "How can the peaceful house of Europe be built if the highest representatives are not on speaking terms or refuse all discussion?"
Mr President, if a mark between 1 and 10 were now to be given for success in pursuing the two objectives of the action programme, namely that Kosovo should be multi-ethnic and that it should remain a part of Yugoslavia, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council and I can probably agree that the mark concerned would be fairly low. We agree, however, that this is the result of a policy which has been pursued up until now, that is to say a result of what has happened.
We need to keep pace and ought not to lose any more time.

Secondly, it is important to point out that, because of the amendment I have just mentioned, "presential" contracts are also covered by Article 15. By "presential" contracts, I mean those that are concluded face to face.
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!
In the motion for a resolution, Parliament, and yourself, Mr McCartin, call for direct payments to be differentiated, in a bid to redress the currently uneven distribution of incomes between prosperous and less prosperous regions, but also between large and small farms.
That is why the public authorities of the Member States and the EU institutions must actively promote racial equality and take concrete action to achieve greater ethnic diversity among their staff.
That actually puts an end to the debate because, as of 19 April, Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 was enacted.

We order African countries to guarantee the plurality of political parties and allow the NGOs freedom of expression, but we negotiate only with Heads of States, the majority of whom represent only themselves, forgetting to invite the NGOs to the Cairo Summit.

Instead, I have the honour of presenting Parliament' s budget before the Commissioner presents the larger budget to us.

Mr President, to begin with, I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for a very good, interesting and tremendously readable report.

I am able to confirm that it is Mr Imbeni' s interpretation which is the correct one.
We must go further and legislate.

Mrs Flesch' s amendment, in my opinion, is taken account of in the text adopted by the committee and not least on the basis of her own amendments.


Mr Deprez, I shall apply the Rules of Procedure.

In addition, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 28.
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.
I find it extremely commendable that the Commission too considers that blood alcohol levels must be kept low among drivers, for safety and alcohol do not go together.


The Commission will certainly take your thoughts into maximum consideration in its forthcoming Green Paper.
Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation, typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation, we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical.

This is what we need for ships.
Combating child pornography and the misuse of the Internet is, therefore, both a worldwide and a specifically European responsibility and we call upon all Member States to take action in light of this report.
This is a crucial problem because it predates our own participation in politics.

Only with complete determination to implement the Rome Treaty will we be able to end the impunity of the perpetrators of these crimes and contribute to the deterrence and prevention of such crimes in the future.

The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.
Contrary to the views expressed by some honourable Members, I believe that the problem with rail transport nowadays is not whether it should be public or private, although it is generally public.
We have already made good progress but we need to build on it very fast indeed, particularly given the deconcentration that I have talked about.

It is not so much the electorate that is to blame, but the structures of the parties themselves, which create enormous difficulties by means which are often less than legal.

We look to him as the man to root out cartels.
Mr President, a successful man once said that half of heaven is borne up by women.


RINA is currently the talk of the town.
The Commission considers that extending the period in this way would reduce the credibility of the central theme of our proposal, which is that the COM in bananas should be brought into line with the WTO rules as soon as possible.

Occasionally, however, there is a problem such as the E-coli outbreak in Scotland.

It is for the Council to respect and apply the relevant provisions of the Euratom Treaty, which does not provide for the Parliament to be consulted on these matters, which is how the Treaties stand.
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).


Mr President, we shall be voting in favour of the report on priorities in EU road safety, as it includes a number of practical measures which may reduce, at least slightly, the number of deaths in road accidents.

It rather surprised me, and I am sure many other Members of the House, who during the formal sitting expressed their surprise at the way in which the vote was interrupted.

I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.
Many of you were present when I spoke to the Agriculture Committee last week.

According to studies and research, men and women working and taking decisions together, a balance between the male and female, could result in a more balanced and fairer world.
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.
As to my second point: monitoring, evaluation and control.


Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.

They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.
And I refer, in particular, to the Greek pensioners.
The next item is the report (A5-0392/2000) by Mr Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(2000) 119 - C5-0272/2000 - 2000/0081(CNS)] on the creation of a Rapid Reaction Facility.

We must send out a positive political message by giving our assent.


Although it only makes up 6% of total European research expenditure, the framework programme fulfils an important multiplier function, a kind of flywheel function.
But there was strong political pressure from the United States, Japan and the European Union, and strong ideological pressure from feminist NGOs generously financed by the Western countries.
Mr President, I feel that we are making rather a spectacle of ourselves. I am reminded of the priest who berates his parishioners because other people do not come to Church.
Isolation would not pay off and would be likely to undermine the endeavours of those who are working in Tunisia to improve the quality of its democracy.


2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	kergan	??

The rapid reaction mechanism will allow us to activate very rapidly and to disburse quickly Community funds in response to crises or emerging crises.
One other outstanding issue which the Commission will follow closely is the question of which Khmer Rouge leader will be put on trial.


Officially, it is the Colombian State combating drug traffickers.

And while I am on the subject of figures, we are talking about approximately 500 000 accidents a year in the European Union alone - not counting third countries - where we will be able to settle claims much more easily in the future. In the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language, foreign laws and so on.
No one is expecting labour-intensive industries to flourish within an overstrained labour market.


I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.
At the same time, we must greet its efforts positively.

I am wholeheartedly in favour - and not just because I am here representing Italy - of all initiatives which bring the Mediterranean countries closer together. Better still, I would like to see an increase in the MEDA regulation' s financial appropriations.
Safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over Eurocontrol' s market.
Mr Mantovani said that we should forgive debt and use the money instead to combat Aids.


Following my visit there about a month ago, we have doubled our Obnova support for Montenegro from EUR 10 to 20m.
I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism.
This syphon has to be blocked, so the annex to the proposal should be deleted and the amendments the Committee on Budgets is proposing should be adopted.

In my opinion, if we have to debate a report like this one, which affects the jobs of four million people, at 5.30 p.m., then the plan for Thursday' s sitting has run up against very big problems as a result of the Friday sittings being discontinued.
There are again problems with the Economic and Social Committee in relation to travel costs and mission expenses.
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.

In addition, EUR 1.4 m from the food security budget line have been made available locally to the delegation and the government of Mozambique.
As far as passenger traffic is concerned, we feel that it is important and that it suffices, at least for the time being, to state clearly that cross-border passenger traffic will also need to be liberalised.

I should also like to point out that the total cost of adapting Cyprus to Community acquis is put at between 500 and 900 million Cyprus pounds, i.e. between EUR 1 and 1.8 billion, while the funding received by the Republic of Cyprus from the European Union is minute.

They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.


We will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail. Today, let me simply stress an obvious point, which is, moreover, the crux of what we want to achieve in Nice and beyond.

There is no truth except the whole truth.
However, the fight against drugs goes beyond crop-spraying. Furthermore, collusion with the United States' military plans is out of the question as far as we are concerned.




In this respect, the reference just now to a permanent human rights observatory for Latin America seems to me entirely appropriate.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely why we wanted to withdraw a number of items.


In the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, a clear decision was made to discuss trafficking in women, or forced prostitution, within the framework of this report.



Regions and stateless nations are ignored.
Instead of high-quality public services which meet users' needs, protect the most vulnerable sectors of society and generate high-quality jobs, the Council has decided to speed up privatisation to satisfy the interests of economic groups and to increase their profits. This will have a harmful effect on employment and on working conditions - which will deteriorate - and on the environment and town and country planning.
We must realise instead that it is essential to reduce these tensions.
Similarly, it is to be hoped that Sankoh will now honour the commitments he entered into last July when he signed the Lomé peace accord and that will allow a long-awaited peace and stability to return to Sierra Leone.
I think that would be a sensible health policy.

To help us swallow this bitter pill, an attempt has been made to give the text a social aftertaste by claiming that it defends the interests of the poorest shea butter producing countries such as Mali or Burkina Faso.

Why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries?

Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.

He has done a service to the committee and also to this House by pointing out that this procedure appears to be almost always one-way.
Parents want quality education, and children who attend school want to actually learn what is important in life.


It gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions. Most strange of all, it risks complicating matters so much further that the Commission, as stated in its proposal of November last year, will be obliged to move directly to a tariff only system.

It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty.
Policy in the European Union as far as freedom of movement is concerned, to the extent that it is pursued by the individual governments of the Member States, is characterised - not in all of the Member States but in the vast majority of them - by a defensive attitude, because in principle most governments in the European Union have as their premise the restriction of freedom of movement and not the granting of freedom of movement, which, incidentally, is defined as one of the four fundamental freedoms in the Treaty establishing the European Community.

That is why, in my opinion, the Commission had to propose financing a new priority, without asking for new money, but rather by examining the possibilities of redeployment within the budget and making the appropriate proposal. And that is what it has done.

The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs feels that a number of the proposed measures are too dependent on the goodwill of individual Member States and it calls for rules at a European level.

In spite of this, I hear tones of optimism and I see European countries queuing up - Mr Brok touched on the issue just now - and falling over themselves in the rush to recognise the Stalinist Pyongyang regime, turning a blind eye to what goes on in the country, to the tragic violations of human rights.


We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.

Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.

Court judgments have been passed on this.
Mr President, I believe Mr Belder has just hit the nail on the head.

Nevertheless, I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new.
The benefit of this mission in this regard, as in many others, is undeniable.

First of all, a disadvantage in terms of principle: agricultural product refunds do, indeed, by their nature circumvent the Community' s expressed preference.
We want to give this trend a huge boost.
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.
Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way. Nor can new ones be created.
Our basic attitude is that competition between different national tax systems is not always a bad thing and that the Member States should, as far as possible, retain their right of decision making in this area.
Improvements and efficiencies need to be demonstrated by every institution and I believe that this can only be achieved through tools such as activity-based budgeting and thorough examination of current policies and systems and procedures.
When Mr Deva asked Commissioner Nielson a question on Mozambique and about the delay in getting helicopters there, it was dismissed out of hand by Commissioner Nielson.
Another matter is that of human rights.

The Portuguese Presidency is now coming to an end and sincerely hopes that the subsequent French and Swedish Presidencies will continue the work which we have together managed to achieve so that they represent the next stage in the consolidation of women' s rights.


Is it really putting words into someone' s mouth, if we pay attention to what a political leader has been saying for many years, when it shows an obvious tendency to go against everything that we want?

The two reports do contain positive elements, but they go so far, in the Zabell report, as to state that the pharmaceutical industry cares about the health of athletes and, in the Mennea report, as to suggest that Member States adopt practical measures in their legislation to encourage private investment in sport.
Mr President, on behalf of the British Conservatives, I should like to offer our strong support to the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism.

As matters stand, infrastructure investments are made in waterways and other transport modes, for example.


The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.

I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.
India and Pakistan were supposed to attempt this on their own, but this only led to a whole raft of small conflicts which - and the previous speakers were right to underline this - have taken on more threatening proportions since both countries have become nuclear powers.

We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency.
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.

We agree, Commissioner, that violence can only create more violence.

The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach, in the medium term, a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.

But the figures tell the true story.

This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.
i think we want to be as empowering as possible
We also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred.
This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting, representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

There is already very active coordination of efforts between Member States, in addition to the many preparatory meetings which have taken place.
The report on combating racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been reached.
Firstly, I would like to say that there is an enormous difference between, for example, producing cars or lorries and producing a film.
We have abstained from voting on Amendments 8, 16, 26 and 45, as we do not think that these amendments sufficiently reflect a good balance between, on the one hand, an effective reporting obligation to combat money laundering and, on the other hand, an advocate' s/lawyer's duty of confidentiality to his/her client and the obligations that this entails.
Parliament asked the Commission to clarify its foreign aid strategy; tick yet again.



The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture.

And why should citizens who receive late payment from public bodies not also receive compensation of 7%?



We must find an effective and manageable solution to that problem.
The principle of the free movement of persons, included in the Treaty of Rome fifty years ago, still encounters many difficulties in its practical implementation.

Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes.
But our objectives can be achieved using methods such as social dialogue, the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund, which has a large budget, mainstreaming, political analysis, research and, finally, legislation.
This is exactly what is stated by certain intellectually honest and courageous Jews who go so far as to deplore the perverse reminders of the only persecution of the Jews during the Second World War, known globally under the vague and religious term of 'Shoah' . These daily, obsessive, exclusive and sometimes frenzied reminders of this persecution are for political and financial purposes which no longer have any connection with the worship of the dead and their remembrance.


It is a fact of life.
Above and beyond these measures, further efforts are required if the strategy is to be complete.

I would also like to use these few, precious seconds allotted to me to point out that it would have been appropriate for these measures governing transport and, in particular, air transport in Europe, to make provision for young and elderly people who enjoy travelling, and that it would have been appropriate to provide flight discounts for them - but not necessarily during peak hours or on peak days - thereby promoting cultural exchanges among both young and elderly people from different States of the European Union.
Or is it to be rights extended to parties other than citizens proper, with a shift, or at least the start of a shift, from democracy based on citizenship towards democracy based on the equal treatment of individuals resident, whether long-term residents or visitors, on European Union territories.

So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.

This is a precision weapon, which must be utilised more.
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.
Mr President, honourable Members, I think I can say with regard to your last request that I would be happy to accept it along these lines.
tuggy1, in my experience, the mozplugger works better

This Parliament should be deeply ashamed of the fact that, one year after the elections, this is still not even in sight.
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.
I am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the European Ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaty, and to the European Parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions.
But it is not in the interests of the International Olympic Committee, the international federations, the sponsors who invest in sport or the pharmaceutical industry.

Another factor is the participation of the European Union under the umbrella of other international actors.

The EU, together with the new administration in the USA, can remove customs barriers for agricultural products and the textile industry.

It is completely unrealistic and utopian to think that the members of national parliaments will ratify a treaty which contains such dismantling of their rights, as useless as it is unacceptable, and such a veritable castration of the national parliaments.

This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.
anyway to control the movies in mozplugger?
We must demand a ban on the manufacture, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium weapons.

We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.
Ultimately, Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat.

I only do so when there is a reason.
We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems.
Mr President, I would firstly like to express my sincere gratitude for the work accomplished by Mr Hatzidakis, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the review of the trans-European networks which, in the coming months, I will have to present to this House.

At the same time, they form a true complement to agricultural policy. They are special products which offer a great deal of added value and employment.

It is totally pointless to return dwell on this fuss.
As there are no objective reasons for choosing 'tariff only' , I propose to retain the first option in the Commission' s proposal, the 'transitional' option, and implement it without moving on to 'tariff only' , but with a review of the operation of this reformed COM at the end of a ten year period.

The Commission' s position is quite clear: the European Union will not in future accept reductions, within the WTO, only in support for export refunds - there will also have to be reductions in all types of support provided by our main competitors in the international markets, ranging from export credits to food aid and state-run businesses.


Firstly, I want to support the points that are made by Mrs Haug concerning the implications of spending in the Balkans.
However, I wish to raise the question of land eligibility, which appears to be a particular problem in the UK.

With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.

That is what we said and that is why we voted in favour of it.

The Swedish prime minister once again reiterated the importance of human rights during the Swedish Presidency.

It is entirely logical to adapt national rail legislation to this new system that lays down rules governing access, pricing policy and standard and consistent management practices within the European Union.
Mr President, too many tragedies have taken place, both inside and outside stadiums: incidents which are evidence of the imbalance and social unease of individuals, a culture where strength is what matters and violence prevails over reason.

We know from what has been said on this subject by Commissioner Byrne that he will not accept the type of formulation proposed by the committee at Article 17a. I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view.
It is a delicate matter when a Socialist from Austria does this, but by no means urgent.
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.
Mr President, in our view the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, as set out in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, are a misinterpretation.

It had a democratically elected government.

Nevertheless, we can, at no great financial or organisational cost, contribute to a better use of the diplomatic resources we already have in the European Union, to everyone' s benefit.

But it is also a fact that, sad to say, the referendum announced for Austria, which representatives of the European and in particular the Austrian People' s Party who are sitting here in this Chamber opposed only a few days ago, could dangerously aggravate the situation and mood in Austria again; for it is reviving anti-European feelings that will certainly not do the work of this Monitoring Centre any good.


I am sure that implication was not intended.
Discussion of other subjects would have to be covered by other means and under a different agenda item.
Blackwell, hey your right, i guess i never thought about it, must be mis-spelled/mis-used so often

We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.

Clearly, as an elected Parliament, we have a duty to protect our citizens, but I fear that the conditionality in paragraph 7 of Mrs Paciotti's report endangers the whole agreement, for it could hardly be more fundamental to the debate about adequacy or equivalence.
In that respect, the agreement is a disappointment.
Is the Council considering lifting the embargo as one of the indispensable conditions for Turkey' s accession to the European Union?
Could you provide us with information on that?
It will be duly corrected, Mrs Laguiller.





But I am pleased that the matter has been cleared up today.

In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.



The flimsy arguments put forward by those who want to reduce the European Parliament' s five-day week in Strasbourg to four days, and who would also prefer not to turn up here on Mondays, are part of their salami tactics, which are obviously aimed at sabotaging Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg for 12 sittings each year, not to mention their objective of transferring the offices of the Secretariat from Luxembourg to Brussels.
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.

My group is fully intent on helping with this work.

The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.

After a relatively quiet period, the recent arrival of a few thousand Jihad fighters who aim to enforce the Islam religion on the Moluccan islands has led to renewed escalations of violence.

I think it is extremely important that we again inform the Council, where everything is diligently recorded, that 40 years after the creation of the European common market, we have made no progress in the railway sector.

A distinction has been made, as I requested, but it is still insufficient.
But then I wonder: if there is talk of a real common policy, of a system of crisis prevention and crisis control at Community level, where are the actual proposals then?

The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.
The increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports.

The baton has now been handed over to France.
Really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular.
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.
This is why we call them "mother tongues" , and no State, whatever it may be, may have the direct, indirect, explicit or implicit goal of destroying one of its mother tongues, or of allowing it to disappear.
We plan to submit the first accession partnership in the autumn of this year.



Mr President, the Commission proposes that the existing regulation be extended.

NGOs can benefit from a number of programmes.
It cannot be right to bring in the Swedish method through the back door, because this implies working towards the goal of a drug-free society across Europe.

The truth is that Greece now meets the convergence criteria, with the exception of the public debt criterion.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.


Little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme.
In other words, with regard to European airlines, there is nothing more to say: we can only negotiate with regard to third country airlines - for which we have some leeway until 2002 - and we would have to suspend that part.










Similarly, Mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms.
For that reason I am pleased that Amendments 43, 44 and 45 have been proposed as a means of covering the available forms of technology in a similar way to another directive and of limiting the initial scope of the regulation to industrial activity, since it is undoubtedly far harder to legislate for the service sector in this domain.



This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).

This does not mean that those countries are not obliged to make air traffic in high air space as flexible as possible and to seek more efficient ways of linking this with military operational needs.
The measures suggested by this House' s Committee on Fisheries are along these lines. They are measures which clarify some concepts to ensure greater accuracy and improve, as far as possible, upon the already significant control measures in NAFO waters.

How much should be charged for the capacity allocated?

We are sitting on the sidelines and can do all too little to bolster the democratic powers.

I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States. Following the American presidential election, the number of death sentences carried out in the United States will reach record levels.
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?
But it should not be forgotten that this was actually a catastrophe that had many surprising elements, nor was it particularly easy for Member States to mobilise and deploy very sensitive and difficult hardware such as helicopters with extreme rapidity.
Madam President, I am also keen to give you Amos Oz' view of this increasingly poignant historical burden.
Madam President, in the context of these issues, a teething problem has arisen with the four-day week in relation to transport.

(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.
We could of course say that it is not our problem, and the fact that it is not prepared to make progress in this area more obvious and is not creating the political institutions for doing so is indeed Turkey' s own biggest problem.
There are other areas that we must look at.

I hope that in September new appropriations will be provided for these lines.

We are persuaded that the guidelines thus defined are, with the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes, essential for proper progress towards the Lisbon objectives.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
This attitude on the part of the leaders of Europe causes a problem for the following reason: the purpose of this intergovernmental conference was supposedly to lay down the institutional requirements for enlargement.

The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4).

What I am saying on my own behalf, not on behalf of the Commission, is that bureaucratic issues are bound to crop up.

Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on this important report.
China is as close to us now as were the totalitarian regimes before the Second World War.

A government has been imposed in power by the military that it is effectively controlled by those supporting the coup and the military is trying to offload the blame by prosecuting one small section of those involved, namely the gang around George Speight
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.

Until now the United Nations has authorised special courts, for example the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

The offence of falsification of records must not negate or obscure the long-term case for reprocessing or MOX fuel assemblies.



Amendments Nos 1 and 2 add the words "at par value" to the report.
The French Presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.

The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.

We have in the Commission five cooperation programmes in China, which total EUR 25 million.

The nature of the EU has not changed.
Personally, when I think in terms of 'energy' I think of security of supply in the long term, the guarantee of public service missions and the contribution to sustainable and environmentally friendly development.

Could we not use our power, our muscle, in order to achieve our human rights objectives and not just go on talking and talking without seeing any results?


The citizens and companies of the Community must be able to have confidence in legislation, as continual shifting of the goalposts undermines long-term plans.

The incompatibility and heterogeneity of the Member States' investments in this field - the national views - make this such a difficult debate that we will have to consider other added problems such as interinstitutional disputes.

If we are serious about this, we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area, both at national and European levels.
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.
Neither has the money often gone into new investment for business but to the owners, who have become millionaires and billionaires.
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas.
We are therefore delighted by the initiatives taken in this direction and warmly welcome the speakers of the two assemblies who have honoured us with their presence.
We must move beyond what has been reactive behaviour, that is to say, behaviour that has worked on the action-reaction principle, and move towards an approach which is ambitious and which looks to the future.

In addition to the introduction of visa requirements, Georgia has faced a number of other crises in its relations with Russia in recent months, in particular, over interruptions in gas supplies, the pace of withdrawal of military bases and rescheduling discussions with the Paris Club.



As we can see, however, when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms, disasters or Europe' s interests, that is, serious matters, they are no longer present.


Operators importing products under the IPR do not receive any refund for the export of processed goods, so the assumption in Amendment No 5 is incorrect.


It will then no longer be a problem for us to grant the protection sought by the Italian Government, or the region concerned.











On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.
We might as well admit it, there are a great many money-grubbers active within the European Union, and organised crime no longer concentrates solely on drug smuggling, the arms trade, trafficking in humans, meat fraud, alcohol and cigarette smuggling, VAT merry-go-round fraud and oil fraud, and has not done so for a long time.

The MEDA democracy programme should continue to be used to fund positive actions and MEDA allocations themselves should be more dependent on adequate progress.
Education and training in all professions involved in protecting, preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage are also important, as are raising pupils' and young people's awareness and developing a movement of voluntary activities which can also make a decisive contribution.
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.
They are unnecessary, as they are already contained in the Commission' s proposal.

At this point, let us mention fundamental freedoms: for these freedoms to be established the embargo policy must be abolished.
JStrike, think what you want
Secondly - and in my opinion of paramount importance - is the need to balance the problem of tyre noise and tyre safety.
B5-0276/2000 by Mr Rod and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;

This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.


I feel this is a very promising beginning, although undoubtedly the subject lends itself to unanimity; indeed, I do not think that, amongst the impressive number of European programmes available to our citizens, there is a report that is as well-known and as much appreciated by the public, and not just by the students; recently, a grandmother stopped me in the street to thank me for what I was doing for her grandchildren, who were travelling abroad thanks to an Erasmus grant.


The path to those goals is partly by way of social and economic development, and the way to social and economic development is partly by means of foreign investment.
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.


I also had the honour of meeting many of the human rights activists in Colombia last year.
We must show a united front, and the same goes for the Ministers meeting in the Transport Council - and you, Mr Jarzembowski, would do well to shout less loudly and at last get round to doing something in your transport committee.
I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete.

Thirdly, we must prepare ourselves for the enlargement of the European Union and this applies to Parliament even more than to the other institutions.


The European Union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at New York.
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.
We wish to make it clear that freedom of religious organisation is a fundamental civil right, which cannot be undermined, curbed or jeopardised, which would be the effect of some of the amendments before us.



hi

That is the way it should be.

It is against this background that the Joint Aviation Requirements, known as JAR-OPS, agreed by the JAA in 1995, are now being transposed into European Union law.
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.


The truth of the matter is that Peres knows that what Arafat is saying is true.
Mr President, the three key factors which typify the transport of people and goods in terms of competition are price, reliability and speed.




Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community.


With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.
The Council has been incapable of proposing a concrete enlargement plan and in this it really has to rally its forces.


I should like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur on her report and I should like to explain why I have praised you and why I should like to take you all at your word.

I consider that to be far too long.


We have to look for new ways to encourage the proper transposition and application of environmental legislation.
We predict that, despite any improvements for the benefit of producers of other vegetable fats, the overall outcome will, in any case, be harmful to the third world.
If the over-exploitation of nature and people is not allowed in Europe, it should not be allowed elsewhere.
To tackle these three concerns raised by our citizens we need a wide and open debate where all key players participate and the discussion cannot be limited only to the experts.




Mr President, yesterday, after the intervention of the President-in-Office of the Council, which had painted an optimistic picture of Community development, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, took the precaution of pointing out that the economic development we are experiencing presented the enormous difficulty that it was accompanied by an increase in the social marginalisation suffered by the European Community.
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.
The solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or EuropeAid or whatever SCR is going to be called.



This debate is now before us, but each and every one of us, male and female, is going to assume their responsibilities without delay.
In Serbia, the centre of the 'Women in Black' is currently under threat of closure.
When there is one large and 20 small insurers, then the large one may not have more than 10 per cent of the market share for the exemption agreement to be accepted.
In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could.
For example, we consider that setting up mandatory disposal consortia according to the model already laid down by the legislation of some Member States could be a practical response to the need to limit the economic impact of disposal operations on breeders and, at the same time, thanks to the increase in the degree of social control over the proper use of the service, to the need to consolidate consumer and environmental guarantees.
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.


We call on the people to step up their fight to stop their self-proclaimed saviours trampling on the rights for which they have fought hard and made sacrifices, and to reverse the current trend, which only serves the interests of those who are exploiting them.
Commissioner, unless we demand that these people are held responsible for their actions, we are the ones who will be held responsible.
Mr President, I am the one who should apologise for having gone on too long, most of all to those Members of Parliament who were unable to ask their questions.
I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425.

The proposal before you today has three main objectives.
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.
I therefore believe that we are now being consulted on an amendment which the Council is introducing in this communication, and that it affects the allocation of competences for this action by the Council.


So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.
So as long as certain parties behave in a way which gives the impression that the system which currently has the upper hand in Turkey could take hold in Europe, then we are again painted into a corner.
B5-0260/2000 by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES);

It is not a product which affects the environment to any great degree.

This is why, only recently, we carried out a reform of Agenda 2000: these price packages tend merely to make annual adjustments in response to one-off situations.

In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.
In our opinion, this issue is relevant to all the institutions, having a bearing on Parliament's own work as well. However, in particular, precisely because the Ombudsman wishes there to be as much focus as possible on his work, we feel that the possibility for the Ombudsman to attach an electronic signature could be the first step towards introducing the use of this vehicle within the institutions.
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The quality of its performance is debatable, but Ambassador Moratinos' role in the region and the Council resolutions have certainly been effective.
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.
Let me illustrate this with an example.
The consequence of this absurd step is that, as is the case in Italy, anyone who is part of the judiciary as an investigating magistrate will become dependent upon the decision-making authorities, with the genuine risk that it will not be possible to conduct inquiries into corruption and the abuse of political power without fear of political pressure.
Apart from the competition law test, we need additional criteria for the purposes of merger decisions, for example: firstly, the companies should give a binding commitment to preserving or raising the level of employment.

Unemployment stands at more than 20% in some regions, regions which have for a considerable length of time been left out in terms of progress due to their remote nature and depopulation, and the employment rate for women is 19 percentage points below that of men.
It is also important to encourage schools to cooperate at national and European level.

As early as the end of last year, the EU took a large step towards revitalising railway transport when it introduced the so-called railway package.




We are not setting out to propose conflicting models of Europeanism, but simply to be more efficient.




We must not allow anyone to wreck this opportunity, nor must we waste it.

Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.
Before we start with the order of business, there are still a number of points of order.
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.

It is not a question of the ratio between the number of refugees and the number of existing citizens. It is a question of the actual task which is to be undertaken.
The EU has kept derogations open for itself here.
In our opinion, such powers are covered by the subsidiarity principle and ought to be exercised at national or lower levels of political decision-making.

Mr President, I am indebted to my esteemed friend, Mrs van der Laan, for making it clear, the last time she adopted a position, that she and her friends intended to repeat the manoeuvre every Friday morning of a Strasbourg part-session.



Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.

In this respect the certification of electricity is an idea to be supported.

This is how we might succeed in changing things.
They look for immediate returns, and currently this is a safer bet in the United States, particularly because of its higher interest rates.
I therefore suggest that we should stick to the provisions on minced beef as laid down in the common position.
Development of the Union can only seriously be accorded priority through also, at the same time, welcoming qualified majority voting in the majority of areas but excluding, for example, the area of new treaties.


I must tell you that this agreement does not offer anything new and that it contains only repressive measures, police measures and impositions.
What is more, the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
In my view this contravenes Rule 50 and Annex III of our Rules of Procedure.

One of them is respect for parliamentary rules and the Treaties.



Monk are you going to try ubuntu?
Before I end, I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am about the agreement reached, at the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council on 20 July, on a statement on financial programming.


A lot can be improved now that we have a civil protection division, specifically with overall responsibility of this kind.


Finally, I would like to ask the PPE Group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here.
(PT) We voted against this report because we consider that in content it differs little from the Commission' s proposal, which aims to put social security totally in the hands of the financial markets, thus weakening or even replacing state pension schemes by stock market speculation. This makes it quite clear what the "modernisation of social protection" agreed at the Lisbon Summit is meant to be.
canon-sane.c: In function `read_fb1200':
Firstly, massive investment in people is needed. A key concept which many of you have mentioned here today is the fact that lifelong training and learning are an investment in people and a decisive factor in these trends becoming an opportunity for everyone.
Having said that, the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium - new needs, enlargement on the horizon - and to make it function effectively.

My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.

But until there is something more, I think it appropriate that the wilder claims and suggestions should be ignored.

Ladies and gentlemen, we trust that the Quaestors will look into the matter.
We also agreed to speed up the procedures for supplying aid to the Balkans.


The European Council calls for closer co-operation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States' border control services" .

Mrs Karamanou has already made an important point: in reality, the Council is not telling us what the current state of the Member States' laws is.



It is not a question of rejecting these people - they have the right to live as families - but of the Commission thinking twice about it and of their being subject to a future directive which would include persons under temporary and alternative protection, while we await the future harmonisation of the Union' s asylum policy.
Thirdly, and finally, we must demand an immediate moratorium on all arms and ammunition of this type until we have the complete results of the tests we have commissioned, so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible manner.
The aim alone does not, however, make the meeting a historic one; what does is the range of measures that the meeting is recommending the Union and its Member States take to achieve their objective.
Research is, first and foremost, a matter for freedom and not for planning.


This may result in the further depopulation of certain disadvantaged areas.


ogra, thanks, ive set it up already




Fine, but let it really serve the cause of the employees.
There are problems in very many places. In rural areas, many teachers are in practice not being paid, and I do not believe that, with the crisis of structural change suffered in the rest of the system, education has been kept in the wonderful state indicated in the statistics.
The jobs of one thousand people in my constituency are now at risk as a result of the decisions that were taken here yesterday.
This also puts a heavy responsibility on our shoulders but, the basis is that we are not only the biggest but also the most predictable and stable donor to work with.
At the moment we have, to name but a few, initiatives such as SLIM, the Business Test Panel, the Regulatory Policy Guidelines and the Better Law-Making Report, not to mention the initiatives relating to codification or the quality of legislation.

In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.

Parliament has scored a major success in achieving this goal, all be it with transitional periods.

It will also have an important side effect in that it will help third countries to manage unexpected emergencies or disasters they would not be able to handle by themselves.
This message must make a genuine contribution to this renewal of the will for integration which, above all in the Maghreb, is a cause for hope at the moment and which must count on an ambitious and also generous contribution from the Union.

Tourist areas, also within our own European Union, do not want to admit that poverty forces poor children into prostitution.

(Applause)Dialogue cannot serve to cover up violence and terror, nor can it mean surrender in the face of crime. Political dialogue is only possible when the bombs cease to go off, the guns are silent and democratic values have been accepted.
We urge the Liberal Group to dissociate themselves from their links with the EPP over the amendments because it has shown itself to have racist instincts in its party.
That is why the French Presidency of the Council intends to continue the efforts made over recent years and help to promote the Union' s international profile.

If contributory pension schemes are having problems, it is only because there are fewer employed people in proportion to the number of retired people, because there are too many unemployed and because salaries are too low.

Otherwise, they involve acceptable supplementary provisions, for example certain cases exempted from the technical specifications.
I concur with your view that we shall be able to make a greater success of enlargement and the actual accession of these countries if we make the best possible preparations at this stage.


If urban transport is not subjected to political considerations and the intervention of local authorities, for example, straightforward liberalisation could make it practically impossible for us to reach our workplaces.
Please allow me to make a correction, Mr President: there are no large and small countries here.
They allow for better monitoring of transit processes and the handling of securities undertaken for the purpose of safeguarding these processes.



Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.
A call for proposals will be published soon.
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.
The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity.

Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.



I have every sympathy for European Parliament's desire to do exactly the same.

On 5 August, the Lebanese Government agreed for the force to be redeployed in the former occupied zone and, since then, UNIFIL has set up a number of permanent posts in the zone and taken up its position along the Israeli-Lebanese border.


anir: there is no need to continue this discussion.
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.


It is our view that the IGC must succeed, that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds, but not at any price.
We are also in favour of EU aid being earmarked for a common follow-up scheme which monitors the experiences of repatriates and which also offers a certain level of guarantee.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask for your cooperation.


This proves the eccentricity of the Bureau's decision to reduce the length of explanatory statements to one page.
Over the last century, these have totally changed in nature.
It stands to reason that they will continue their political struggle as political prisoners.

wow
I agree with the view that, in these new circumstances, an improvement in the quality of public finances must involve greater public investment. This is a point which the Commission has highlighted in the different stability and convergence programmes and, clearly, it is a point which we must continue to stress.


Do we want an own-initiative report? Do we want to take other measures in order to shed more light on the outstanding issues, to obtain more answers and, above all, to examine whether Community law has been broken?

It would, however, be unfair to say that no progress has been made.

The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.


This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility.
Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that human cloning which seeks to reproduce a human being similar to another with the sole purpose of improving it must be clearly prohibited.
I therefore call upon the French Council Presidency to rethink this list of priorities and to reorganise it in terms of real priorities, rather than ranking the objectives according to how difficult they will be to accomplish.


They seek to replace emission ceilings that are designed to meet the agreed Community target for acidification, and to protect our citizens' health, with the emission ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol.
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.

Let there be investment, then, in a culture of initiative.
quest... I know people have had luck with mozplugger I think
Food safety is a top priority and we must work hard towards alleviating the fears of consumers.


It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.





The first area is the deletion of references to a tariff only system and an automatic move to such a system after a certain transitional period.


It is in fact the job of the polluters to pay the costs for cleaning the areas suffering as a result of their actions, and for the restoration of the ecological balance damaged by their actions.
Dko: np
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.


(FR) The purpose of the programme that we have been debating today is to organise the dismantling of the Joint Research Centre' s nuclear installations and the management of waste resulting from their nuclear activities.




If there are specific problems, then the two-year period may be extended for a further year, but the Member State must incorporate the procedure in full.
I am thinking in particular - in response to Mr Sanchez García and Mr Theonas - of the outermost regions.

In this respect, we, the Socialists, would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility.


(Mixed reactions) ... you see, you are proving the truth of what I am trying to say.


Despite the fact that, apparently, the Commission will have to be notified of such measures, there is a great deal of concern among farmers, and also amongst those in the meat-processing industry, and certainly among our local butcher shops, who, at the end of the day, will have to take the first blow.
In the French version the Commission' s initial text uses the phrase 'sans distinction de race ou d' origine ethnique' .
E467 is problematic in terms of assessing its harmlessness, because it contains extremely dangerous impurities.
I should like a clear answer on this.


In all contacts with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the European Union has emphasised its great concern about the serious violations of human rights in the country, about the number of political prisoners, about the absence of national legislation and about the Korean authorities' refusal to cooperate with international mechanisms in defence of human rights.
k

During yesterday' s vote on the Buitenweg report, we witnessed some very serious goings-on in this Parliament.

I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .
Firstly, in the draft regulation, 50% of European meat is effectively exempt from compulsory labelling if it is minced or cut.


But in a number of areas there is little recognition by the Commission of the benefits the aviation industry, including aerospace, have brought and I am disappointed by the negative attitude towards the industry in this paper.





We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly.



The Ecofin Council will primarily assume responsibility for strengthening the Cardiff process, the action plan for financial services, the action plan for venture capital, the tax package, the mid-term review of the employment guidelines and for the assessment of the contribution made by public finances to growth and employment.
In these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women, prostitution and pimping.

Subject: Involvement of labour and management In various Member States there is no dialogue of substance or effective cooperation between government bodies and representatives of labour and management on employment-related issues or, in a broader context, efforts to modernise the European social model.

16 million citizens cannot, and will not, allow themselves to be labelled as such all because of the activities of an extremist minority.
That woman was sobbing her heart out.

The next item is the report (A5­0373/2000) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on a report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of Council Recommendation 96/694 of 2 December 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process [COM(2000) 120 - C5-0210/2000 - 2000/2117(COS)].






The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.

We hope that the wording selected will allow the Commission to finalise a European party statute quickly, not set the majority requirements in the Council too high and respect full co-decision for the European Parliament.
So it must be borne in mind that this has to do with helping the poorest countries to determine those areas in which they can manage the remaining debt.
After all, quite a few people have been left wondering if there is a strategy underlying Commissioner Verheugen' s comment.

That information was passed on to the Commission, since it is one of the EU institutions responsible for risk management.
As these same companies at the same time employ more and more people, as we heard today in your presentation, Mr Monti, and are therefore boosting economic growth in Europe, I do not really understand the fears that have been expressed over there at the other side of the Chamber that these mergers, which are fully beneficial to society as a whole, should have a detrimental effect on employment in Europe.
With regard to the promotion of equal opportunities in the context of policies on cooperation with development, I would like to point out that, in my view, efforts in this area should concentrate especially on guaranteeing girls' access to primary education, which means at the same time ensuring that it is free.
(DE) Mr President, I apologise again for my mistake a moment ago!

Profitability in production is shaky, and this rather pointedly begs the question as to whether agricultural production in Europe makes sense any longer.
It is therefore important that we recognise and welcome people who are seeking a better future in the EU' s Member States.

Mr President, in its wisdom, the House has made a decision on Friday sittings.

The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience. These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.

There was no law and order, as those who were police by day were Malaitan militants by night and they opened their armouries to the Malaitans on the morning of the coup.
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.

I entirely approve of the Dary report which opposes the automatic move to a 'tariff only' system and which defends the principles which presided over the establishment of the common organisation of markets, especially Community preference.

In that spirit, we can fully endorse Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 30, 33, 37 and 41 and we can partially accept Amendment Nos 4, 5, 6, 10, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, 35, 38 and 40 providing some slight verbal modifications.

I hope that with his encouragement the European Union will continue to play its part in ensuring that the Korean Peninsula, the region and, indeed, the world, enjoy peace and prosperity.
Respect for intellectual property is nevertheless a source of vitality in the audiovisual and cinematographic sector and the proposal for a directive on copyright and associated rights in the information society must therefore be speedily adopted, both to protect created works and to ensure that they are accessible and can circulate freely.

Yet people often do not realise that taking drugs and medicines can cloud their minds and affect their driving just as much.
The huge industrial changes of recent years that have resulted from the increase in globalisation, new technologies and social transformations have given rise not only to economic growth and new production sectors but also to a growing number of company mergers, closures and relocations, which have resulted in the loss of local markets, unemployment, the degradation of social and labour protection systems, greater social exclusion and enormous human suffering.



We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations.


If you have any respect for your position and for the rights of Members...

We have to find a way forward which reconciles complying with the Treaties, especially in terms of the rules of competition, and regional policy.
I do not feel that the request should be addressed to all the States in general: it should be addressed to those whose legislation falls short.

But the choice, as legal basis, of the article relating to industry conforms to consistent case law which lays down that in the framework of the system of Community powers, the choice of the legal basis of an act must be founded on objective factors capable of jurisdictional control and such factors notably include the aim and the content of the act.

The Council' s amendments, which extend the scope of money, cannot be in the interest of the consumer. We need electronic money which is valid in a given environment.
I have just one argument in defence of equality, not just political equality but equality in general.


Cecil Rhodes, one of Britain's most successful colonists, said the purpose of colonialism was: "To find new lands in which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap labour that is available from the natives of the colonies" .
Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject.

Targets and limited reference points must be established which will maintain the fish stock at a high enough level that the risk of stock depletion or collapse is insignificant.

This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.


It is not solely a concern of the EU, and we must seek international and global consensus in international forums.





I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.



To that extent, we support the rapporteur' s recommendation and thank him again for the work he has done.

It is therefore right to call for a single air traffic control system, at least for the whole of the European Union, which clearly needs to include Switzerland for technical reasons.

Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.

Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.

My next comment is addressed to my honourable friend, Mr Pöttering: it was you who said at a European Union conference "onwards and upwards" , and that enlargement should be speeded up for political reasons, because we cannot afford to put it on the back burner.
We have already emphasised that no more obstacles should be put in the way of enlargement of the Union.


And we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions.

What are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation.

I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.



I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.

Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.
In addition to that, the report emphatically calls for the European imposition of an energy tax.
I think some momentum is being lost, Mr President.
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?

The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress.

In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres, we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective.

He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.

I certainly agree with what he said in the last part of his answer about the need for capacity-building in the least developed countries as well as, perhaps the need for asymmetrical measures, resulting in a certain level of protection for their markets that we do not seek to enjoy in return.


In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.

The regulator, who is to be appointed under the terms of the conciliation and who is to oversee the system, is also an important factor because it is important to create confidence in the railways and in the solution we have now arrived at.

Angola, for example, has powerful armed forces which could have given valuable assistance, or Zimbabwe, just next door, or Nigeria, which has an operational air force.

Mr President, in the time available, I wish on behalf of the Economic Committee to stress three issues that we considered to be of cardinal importance when we examined the annual report on the Community's financial interests and the fight against fraud.

The scheme for whistle-blowers, much applauded by Mrs van der Laan, leaves a great deal to be desired.
They say: "We are turning waste into energy - isn't that wonderful?" when in actual fact they are trying to hoodwink the public into believing that this is something that is ecologically sound.

However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.

In that process we have to remember the issue of nuclear safety, which is a problem that affects us all.
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.

Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.
Nevertheless, I would like a further step to be taken because, in my view, the MEDIA Plus document follows a principle which is rather like that of arts cinema: it supports in particular the script and the production when these days we know that post-production accounts for 60%, 70% or 80% of good films.
But we should try for institutional revolution.

We would like to highlight and draw attention to the fact that formulating even more harmonized criteria for granting asylum by gradually and effectively moving away from those laid down in the Geneva Convention and essentially replacing them with regulations such as those mentioned in the report, may have a negative and repressive impact.

It is perhaps our only chance of beating the United States.


All that is necessary is to prove compliance with existing European legal provisions.

For young families, the difficulty of reconciling full-time work with family and children is becoming ever greater.




If they cannot do it on that, what is to say they will do it on this?
Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks, which is certainly not acceptable.
Step by step, the Ombudsman has developed his work, endeavoured to obtain better administration and gained the trust of the citizens.
Secondly, on nuclear safeguards: according to the investigations carried out by the UK nuclear installations inspectorate, the falsification of data occurred during a secondary manual diameter check of a sub-set of the MOX pellets in the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility.

Support for civil society is key to the development of the human dimension of the partnership.
If we need information, we can in any case always access case-by-case details via national IACS operations and through national payment agencies.

I also agree with the rapporteur when he criticises setting up an advisory panel to deal with irregularities. We have, of course, established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities.

This illustrates what the present debate teaches us: that we must have comprehensive regulations for the whole of the common market constituted by the EU.
I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place.

Marble2, yes. Sadly
We must congratulate ourselves in Europe on some progress but not enough has been achieved.

For example, we have looked at language laws in Lithuania, Estonia and Slovakia, a subject that was raised during the debates, and legislation regarding the Roma in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.



And because the Commission' s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach.
I think that this aspect cannot be stressed enough.
We have supported this liberalisation process so that bilateral barriers may be lifted, ownership restrictions changed, technical standards harmonised, and suitable safety standards established and so that the conditions of liberalisation may promote greater transparency with regard to how air transport development policy is framed and allow, above all, the inclusion of environmental considerations in production within the aeronautical industry, in tariff policy and in the management of air traffic.

There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.
There is a danger of the European Union' s one day being ridiculed and taken advantage of internationally because of its generosity.



The demagogic generosity of these systems has a very high cost which someone is going to have to pay very soon, and its effects will soon make themselves felt on the stability of the euro.

The UN responded by passing Resolution 661 to impose sanctions on Iraq.
The first was that nothing will prevail without a strong civil society in Turkey.
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.

The conclusions of this study that we are carrying out will also be taken into account in the revision of the guidelines on the Trans-European Networks and, furthermore, the INTERREG II programme has also financed general studies on the suitability and viability of a future central crossing in the Pyrenees, adapted to heavy goods transport.
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.

Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
I am delighted Mr Marchiani' s amendments reaffirming the criminal nature of child sex tourism have been incorporated but, at the same time, I am disappointed at the rejection of other amendments tabled by my colleague which were intended to strengthen the principles set out in the text, without altering its general meaning.

If, however, I have misgivings about introducing a new set of human rights into the EU Treaties, this has to do with the confusing signals which would in that way be sent out and with the fear that existing instruments which are operating well would be put at risk.
But as these directives and recommendations originated in the objectives of the internal market, it is only logical that they are all confined to the sphere of employment and working conditions.



The target, regional radio and television stations, is an obvious one from a Milosevic viewpoint.

The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.


It is up to us to guide it through this in the interests of society.



We therefore approve of the Commission' s proposal but we do not approve the PPE' s proposal, which is intended to delay the entry into force of this regulation, or the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, since it considers that the regulation amounts to an amendment rather than a mere clarification, in reality delays its entry into force.
For the rest, the motion for a resolution extends - with a few brief references - to very serious matters, such as the analysis of and the need for research into depleted uranium, but makes no mention whatsoever of the constant efforts being made to confuse and conceal the facts, independent research which we all know about and even official texts issued by NATO countries on the danger of depleted uranium and the protective measures which they themselves impose on their forces.

Mr President, this joint debate is tackling issues which will shortly be at the centre of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum.

Secondly, because scientific information is as yet incomplete and we need to establish beyond a doubt whether there is a cause and effect relationship between the use of weapons containing depleted uranium and the health problems that we have been seeing.
Finally, for the Basque citizens whom I represent, there can be no excuses based on internal affairs or on political opportunism.

So in parallel with the implementation of processes to promote literacy and education in general, we must also engage in some collective thinking about the living conditions of children in the various countries, especially in urban areas, and assist in projects to look after street children in third world countries, and also in our own countries, developing pilot schemes inspired, for example, by the family pre-school proposed by ATD Quart-monde.
I believe it is extremely important that when, in this context, we decide about this report, we send out a crystal clear signal about the firmness of our judgement on the issue of food safety.
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.


A higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the WTO.



The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link.
The same report states that these EUR 1 019 million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the iceberg.

When Commissioner Patten states, for example, that we are talking about reforms, about closing the gap between commitments and payments, then that deserves our full support.
The amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support.

(FR) There is indeed a project, or rather studies, in progress with regard to the transportation of water from the Rhone to Catalonia, but - for the time being at least - it does not involve the French or Spanish authorities.

These fires represent a considerable hazard, damaging the forest stand and the environment throughout the European Union, but, most importantly, the economic effect on our endeavours to boost employment in the tourism industry in all the countries of the Mediterranean area will be extremely serious.

That is certainly not to say that there is no room for improvement in the Union' s Mediterranean policy as matters stand.

Quite simply, citizens from individual Member States are subject to visa requirements in some third countries.

Mr President, the Commission would like to join several of the speakers in thanking the rapporteur for his excellent report on the draft Council decision.


It contravenes the International Declaration on the Rights of the Child and, in particular, Article 10 of this.
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.

The same applies to the Community patent - for we will not be able to sell that either - to procurement rules and the capital market and to the beginnings of the coordination of social security, because there is no point in us dreaming up great expectations of mobility or developing such successful programmes as ERASMUS or SOCRATES to make people more mobile, if our social security rules do not then support this mobility.
Unfortunately, this is going to give environment policy a bad name.
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.

We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13(5) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as "EU origin".

Mr President, I believe the issue of ensuring integrated and correct implementation of the Community' s environmental policy is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the Member States today.


Should the need arise, the offended party can always take the necessary action through the appropriate channels.




Doping is a huge, international problem, as already pointed out by the rapporteur, who has drafted an excellent report, and it is therefore vital for there to be international cooperation in this respect.

In so doing, with a single stroke of the pen, it creates several million new EU citizens entitled to freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, and in fact they even have the right to vote at local and European elections. Yet at the same time, your colleague Mr Verheugen, is calling for a referendum on eastwards enlargement.
Therefore, I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking, by first reading, for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement.
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.
In conclusion, I think that we must improve our commitment: I agree with the rapporteur when he advocates that our interest in high technology and knowledge-based industries must not mean that we forget the more traditionally structured businesses involved in tourism, trade, crafts and in services in general.
The Commission is always accusing Member States of not transposing its decisions and directives into their national legislation, while it is doing exactly the same thing on an international level.
Mr President, I am a firm supporter of the fight against any form of racism and xenophobia, but I abstained from the vote on Mrs Ludford' s resolution because I see it as one of those hotchpotch resolutions that tries to cover all manner of things and sometimes contradicts itself.

There will be no real partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean until the organised movement of people is put on the agenda.

Mr President, when Mr Solana came to visit our group last week and was questioned about the outcome of the Cairo Summit, his answer was that the atmosphere had been good, which is more important than an outcome.

Questions remain about parliamentary and judicial control in the second and third pillars, as they do about the status of European parties and so on.

I would like to highlight an important aspect which was probably not taken into consideration when discussing this age limit: an ever increasing number of applications for asylum are submitted by minors, and such situations need to be monitored using technical procedures of this kind.
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.

I am especially thinking of the progress on what I consider the most important item in the negotiations: the extension of qualified majority voting and, consequently, the extension of codecision.


Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.

The next item is the report (A5-0335/2000) by Mr Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Growth and Employment Initiative - Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job creating Small- and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) - As at 31 December 1999 [COM(2000) 266 - C5-0507/2000 - 2000/2245(COS)].
I hope therefore that, by means of the vote tomorrow, we can make our contribution to solving the health and environmental problems involved in waste incineration so that the enormous quantities of waste which we produce every single day do not cause more serious health problems or greater damage to the environment than is absolutely necessary.
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures.

However, as the French Presidency rightly pointed out, enlargement must not weaken the Union' s action either.

A contributory factor to the lack of freedom in that country is the Serbian University Law promulgated in October 1998, since when many professors have been removed from their posts.
This is particularly important because the product world is becoming more and more complex and it is becoming more and more difficult for individual persons who have suffered damage to provide proof in this area.
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.
But it should be determined individually by each employee, as the Commission proposes.
The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development.

doktortomoe: i am trying 3 different linux os from last one week or so.. in search of which one suits me best.. but why should i invest all the time??
We have arrived at the final question.

So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.
It is clear from the current debate that the European Parliament has asked the Commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea.
Mr President, we have started a new round - the umpteenth - in Milosevic' s war against the free media. So much is clear.
Commissioner Patten pointed out a while ago in the Committee on Budgets that, within category 4, there are eight and a half year-old commitments which have still not been paid out.

In view of these considerations, it is indeed necessary to conduct tests for safety's sake.











Secondly, the role of European cooperation in this area.
We have to take tougher action.

What we must realise is that, as we enlarge Europe, we have a significant responsibility for ensuring that any country that wishes to join the European Union must also reform the way that it treats minorities and the way that it treats the whole question of race discrimination.
However, we welcome the approach which you have taken, i.e. the fact that Amendments Nos 15 and 29 point out that some people will probably try to interpret discrimination on the grounds of racial origin as discrimination on the grounds of religion and I agree that the directive must be strengthened on this point and that the Member States must also clearly draw the attention of the courts and other competent authorities to this danger when dealing with the issue of the right to take legal action against discrimination.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the last time we debate this issue, even though it is so far only the second time we have done so.
Clearly this is very complex subject and Mr Nielson did not appear to really know what the Commission position was.
The report indicates the need for financial transparency between Member States and undertakings.
With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean, including environmental aspects, water management, natural resource management, conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage, socio-economic modernisation and so on.
We need ways of comparing educational expenditure and revenue throughout Europe, as well as ways of comparing qualifications.
Then of course there is the 'get them on board' scenario, irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not.
I would call on the Commission, and Europe has more or less pledged to use the same scale, to take the 3 to 4% really seriously and expand it.

This solution, of progress towards a shared currency, would probably attract the support of the countries within the European Union which, until now, have remained outside the euro zone, creating a shared point of reference for everyone, and putting an end to the current schism, which is disastrous for the credibility of Europe as a whole.
The Council and Commission have already explained why this amendment cannot be adopted, namely because this issue is a purely internal affair.
According to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage.
sivang and Treenaks were both at the conference and did good work there and both have been active in trying to help define what a country team is through planning and example

I think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in Ireland.
If the SEA is to be a genuinely useful tool, the directive must be sufficiently broad in scope and the environmental report and the assessments must naturally be of very high quality.



In fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in France, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users.
Within the sphere of influence of such a triangle, advice and consultation, risk assessment, risk management and sanctions could be dealt with within the framework of existing regulatory mechanisms and could provide an identical level of food safety throughout the Union.

We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees, and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes.





Mr President, the excessive rise in the price of oil is not without its causes, but there is a risk that, because of its own large share of responsibility for these causes, Europe will not take account of them.
I am therefore pleased that my amendment concerning human dignity - unique to each person, yet common to all and inviolable - obtained support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for we must establish a common view of human beings as the effective basis for the EU' s urgent, global fight against the death penalty, its struggle on the side of life and also its fight against torture, against the sex trade and against sexual exploitation.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.
Do we want a committee of inquiry?

This does not mean that the Commission may not present proposals for the redeployment of appropriations, but rather that - as the Commission itself has continued to say - this will not affect direct aid to farmers either.


On the subject of the Spinelli building, I would point out that it was acquired at too great an expense and in an unusual way, not easily seen through.
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.
Would you like to get the quorum checked now?




Developing cabotage has an immediate impact on social and economic development in our regions and hence on the cohesion of the European Union.
Thirdly, I recommend that you read the conclusions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which introduce a cultural dimension, which is very important to the success of this information campaign.

To then talk of rigorous financial management to us alone is, of course, completely misplaced, especially as we here in Parliament are in favour of economical financial management.

Nevertheless, it seems to us to be inadvisable to accept the amendments which make 2010 the time limit, the only one in the short term, and set 2020 as the time limit for long term objectives.

Mr President, we shall shortly be debating Mrs Lalumière' s motion for a resolution on European security and defence.
And I would go so far as to say that people seem to be in great fear of achieving a degree of coordination and harmonisation.




In the same way, the Commission ought to have shown similar respect for Swedish alcohol policy by having extended and made permanent Sweden' s 1994 derogation concerning private imports of alcohol.





We have achieved a great deal, but there is still much to be done.
I also believe that this discharge, the excellent report by Mrs van der Laan, leaves these issues, which are key to the credibility of EU administration, unresolved.
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.

Generally, they too are elected Members of Parliament: Mr Gomes, Mr Costa, Commissioner Vitorino, in principle we are all in the same boat.

We are now trying to create a more rational system in which we can all have a proper political discussion early in the process on what our priorities should actually be.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on her excellent report and urge you to endorse it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if economic and social cohesion is rightly called the core of European policy, then it is safe to say that the Structural Funds act as its pacemaker.
Mr President, I propose that the words 'which have not done so' should be inserted after the words 'the Member States' , in that Italy, for example, already has stringent legislation against racism in place, and I am sure that absolutely nobody in my country would consider that it needs to be changed.
But what have we seen since then?
That is the key difference compared with the current states in Europe.
Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules.
I believe that the relationship between the Community' s eco-labelling programme and the national eco-labelling programmes is better and more clearly defined in the current proposal.

In that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere.



Madam President, the situation in South Africa is difficult - and it is by no means an easy country to run.

For example, at Schiphol, there is a kind of complaints desk for noise.



Mr Vitorino, whom I would like to thank for his speech, can give us that, provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources.

I recommend to Mr Poettering that he reads the report carefully.

Currently we have three different tests which have been found to give excellent results when used to test animals with clinical signs of disease after their death.

Border crossings have to be prevented along a 700 km stretch of country which is hard to monitor.


Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must put an end to the tug of war over a system that complies with the WTO Agreement.


Finally, while maintaining the TAC and quota system at the heart of the CFP, we wish to restate the value we attach to respecting the principle of relative stability and our opposition to the privatisation of quotas.
However, it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today.
This is not to mention the reasons for this approval which are difficult to understand given the basic policy.

I hope that we are not to read too much into this apparent emphasis upon the intergovernmental character of EU cooperation.
Mr President, I have two short minutes in which to make four points.


For these the Council has kept the Commission' s figure for commitment appropriations.
I can only concur with what Mr Martin said.
So the directive is, in my opinion, the most relevant instrument to address these minimum standards for asylum procedures which will have to reflect the cornerstones of the policy of the European Union with regard to asylum as was underscored by the European Council in Tampere: an absolute respect for the right to seek asylum, a full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and maintaining the principle of non-refoulement.
Make sure they are properly in force and please learn from the UK' s past mistakes.
We, the two rapporteurs, and all the groups in the House are willing to reach a compromise.
I would ask the Members who this morning requested that the vote be postponed in the absence of a quorum to consider the following: if you want to reform the Rules of Procedure, which are indispensable in this House, if you want to improve our working practice, you cannot achieve this through impulsive actions; instead you must initiate a full debate on reform of the House.
As you know, this commission also deals with the question of reparations in the aftermath of the Gulf War.

As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.
Within the constraints of the budget and of sound macro-economic policy - I underline those as President Prodi has already done - strictly speaking our European social models offer a welfare safety net.
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.
The present interim government has no democratic basis.

France would certainly seem to be the odd man out in Europe, where, in most countries, air traffic control is administered by agencies, under state supervision but open to private capital.
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.
A further point: the new economy is something which the European economic and social model will have to address, and it must exploit all the opportunities for development and new jobs it provides.
I am thinking, for example, of nitrites, nitrates and sulphites which are known to present proven health problems.
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.

Intense consultation with industry to establish a ban from within and to introduce self-regulation in the processing of these substances, came to nothing.
Pseudo-legal arguments have also been put forward, such as the supposed incompatibility with the directive on abusive clauses or with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.

The Commission must also retain the right to carry out checks in relation to IACS.
The role of the SME sector as a locomotive force for innovation and research work must also be clearly borne in mind.


In capitalist societies, however, in both the audiovisual and in other sectors, the beneficial consequences of technological progress are being stifled by the forces controlling it; to wit, by monopolies making profits not by improving the quality of artistic creation, but by controlling the markets, subjecting people to misleading advertising, dictating ideological beliefs and creating specific consumer standards, even for culture.
This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%.



Let us just mention the unspeakable attitude of the countries of Europe, particularly those responsible for the bombing raids on Serbia and Kosovo, with regard to the refugees forced into exile, many of them precisely because of these bombing campaigns.

It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.

Mr van den Bos has already mentioned them in his speech.
Mr President, Mr Guterres, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to hear the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency declaring full employment to be an aim of European policy.
On one point, there is a need for nostalgia: we want to maintain a small part of the history of Europe and keep historic railway lines in their original state.


The principle which the Commission upheld before the Council and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and upon which the proposal is based is that the directive must embrace all rolling stock used on the trans-European railway network.
With regard to agriculture, I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very easy to say that we are going to open up agriculture to free trade as well.


My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?


In that case, it also deserves stronger support on our part.




We expect and hope that the Commission will deliver and the rapporteur will perhaps take a more considered approach in her final report.
It is becoming clear - poignantly so - given the price level in the EU but also outside, that we still need refunds, and there is also an indication that the difference in power between producers and farmers worldwide and those who sell their products is still far too pronounced.

I still do not know how Mr Berthu voted, not that I am interested, but this is not an explanation of vote, this is just a continuation of the debate.
Mr President, as usual each spring, between the flowering of the plum and cherry trees, we are treated to a fashion show of the latest moral and intellectual campaigns in the fight against Satan, his vanities and his works or, to use the accepted expression, against xenophobia, racism and antisemitism.
On behalf of the party which I represent, the Alleanza Nazionale, I therefore join you all with the utmost solidarity in severely condemning incidents which make us ashamed to be European.
The untrammelled free market seems to be their only god.

The other summit, with China, will be held in Beijing on 23 October.
In the meantime, Mr President, we are making progress in the area of trust and mutual recognition and the Council has submitted a proposal that is supported by the various Member States.
The second option is a Commission with one Commissioner per Member State, but not all sitting at the same time, which would mean the Commission would remain more collegiate by nature.

We must therefore, once again, strongly reiterate our firm and cooperative position as the Commissioner said, in support of a strong democracy, given that terrorism constitutes a direct threat to our core values.
But it then continues: "forward this resolution ... and the governments of the Member States" .
In the run-up to this debate a whole series of requests for amendments, which it was hoped we would adopt here, were sent to me from the Council.
lkerscher: furthermore, those aren't necessary for Ubuntu, which includes most of those packages in either main, universe, or multiverse repos


0.01 is clearly not a substantial part.
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.
I therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure.


Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.



However, it cannot be denied that, as has already been mentioned, the points and issues we are discussing today are the same as those dealt with by the Gallagher and Poignant reports.
This is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course.


Minister, nine months after Turkey was granted candidate status in Helsinki, and irrespective of my opposition to Turkey' s accession, do you believe that there has been any progress with democratisation, which was one of the criteria for accession, or have you concluded that what we forecast at the time has come true, i.e. the Helsinki resolution has encouraged the Turkish regime to continue its inhumane policy?
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.
The rapporteur has already indicated in her speech that, in spite of this basic affirmation of the direction and necessity of this directive, there were several motions for amendment and also several areas of discussion which went even further.
In addition, we should develop cooperation on drugs, terrorism, migration, good governance and conflict prevention, at least with the Maghreb countries.

If we only set up a temporary committee, the European Parliament will just be viewed as a paper tiger in its endeavours to cast some light on the activities of Echelon.

I believe that it is also important for the Commission, with regard to the Balkans, to take account of the fact that there is a country which could become a bridge - having before been a barrier - towards the Balkans, and that is Croatia.
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.




There can, in my opinion, be no doubt that the issues covered in the three amendments rejected by the Council are real issues and that the Council position, or the sub-text at least, indicates a hypocritical disposition to sweep them to one side or underestimate their importance.


you can retry to put it again and see if it bugs
Among recent forms of human rights violations, the instances of disappearance or extrajudicial execution, often preceded by torture, are particularly despicable.

This amounts to a completely unprecedented sign of confidence in Europe' s future and in the future of our economy and our social cohesion.
The Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has furthermore taken care to include this issue in its working programme and has ensured that it was a key part of the agenda of the Cairo Euro-African summit.
Mr President, I would like to make it just as clear that although my first name is Bertel, I have not become a Lord.
It is stated in one of the items, item 48, that the directive does not affect Member States' ability to prevent a certain amount of illegal activity by imposing demands upon service providers who store information from their clients.
The pragmatic approach is also the way forward if we want to achieve Member-State-specific liberalisation, for, in our opinion, we should not speed up the directive' s implementation but rather carry it out gradually.
A first-class Danish Shetland pony stallion named Vivaldi and his progeny were denied entry into the main section of the Swedish Shetland pony stud book.


This is the only way we will prevent the old Europe from becoming a decrepit Europe.
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.
Mr President, the state of tropical forests is worrying on two counts, as the impoverishment of the forest is not only quantitative but also qualitative in nature.
That is why it is impossible for the Commission to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12, which would involve an increase in the financial framework.
As the honourable Member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party.
Such obvious imbalances stack up, distancing us from the objectives of peace, democracy and sustainable development contained in the Barcelona Declaration.
Mr Lannoye, the rapporteur discussed this question with the competent services yesterday.
To minimise the risk to these population centres of course.
Chibifs?
Coordination within the Commission and complementarity with the Member States and other donors are factors which are fundamental to the efficiency which reform is intended to produce.

This is not a matter for the Council.
In February 1996, the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication.

Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.
Mr Murphy, I note your statement.
So there is a problem, but there is no need to panic.
I think that we all know the rules by now.




A trade ban, as called for by unions in Australia and New Zealand, would result in the dismissal of more than 40 000 workers in the clothing and tourist industry, and that should be avoided.

This has to be emphasised in the present debate.

If I've got the correct stuff in "route -n" what could cause me to not be able to ping the router given I connected it up correctly physically too?
The banana controversy is a good example of how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the fifteen Member States, the Union, the ACP banana producing countries, European consumers and our trading partners.
Nor must we forget that refugees and immigrants have a positive influence on the Member States.
bur[n] er_, packet shapers
The 'safe harbour' system proposed by the American authorities offers no protection at all.

Mr President, with the adoption, without amendments, of the common position of the Council, the European Parliament is rising to the challenges of the current changes, to the demands of the new economy, at last setting rules in place governing the use of the Internet for trade and the provision of services.

In particular, the national procedures for ratifying enlargement are purely national issues.

What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.
Madam President, it is all very well Mr Poos saying that the Quaestors asked for the air quality check.
On 16 October 2000 in Minsk, the parliamentary troika of the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE delivered a sharply critical report on the lack of democracy in Belarus in connection with the elections held there.
It is therefore necessary to consider the position which we want to, and must, accord aviation.
The report to be presented to the Feira European Council includes a document establishing the principles and terms of this relationship during this interim period.

Mr President, my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, would like to add its voice to the expressions of sympathy for the families of the victims of the recent earthquake, and for the people of El Salvador, following this latest tragedy.
The Council' s proposal for a decision is correct but is, in my view, timid and does not go far enough.
It argues that, at the end of the day, the Member States have to put their national budgets in order too.
It is therefore necessary, as a matter of urgency, to adopt an overall strategy at European level in order to make up for lost time.

fabbione: hm, is linux-sparc64 in your archive?


An explicit recognition in the forthcoming European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights of a wholesale ban on gender-based discrimination and with it, inclusion in the treaties themselves, would then also create the necessary scope for a new EU policy to promote the position of women in all relevant social fields.

vegai, I am using firestarter
The British Government, without any prior consultation with other countries - and I emphasise this point - has apparently opted for the second approach, by declaring itself to be in favour of therapeutic cloning.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report.
The Commission absolutely must examine all forms of common legislation on prostitution which would give real status to prostitutes in order to protect these women and men from pimping, violence and marginalisation.
Mr Virrankoski, on your question whether the Commission is taking account in its proposal of Parliament' s decision that the resources needed for assistance to the Western Balkans should not come primarily from the agriculture budget, we have indeed taken that decision into account.

The participation rate has risen and is now just under 50% of the figure aimed at.
In particular, on 7 December last, President Prodi undertook to find and propose legal and organisational solutions to give both internal and external candidates to Commission competitions access to their examination papers.
We expect this mission to express its findings in the clearest terms and to come up with unequivocal results.



We must all bear in mind that we should be trying, in this specific area, not to aggravate the bilateral tensions which may arise here or there, where these clearly do not involve fundamental principles of identity and the basic interests of the country.

As you can see in this budget, this is a political debate which goes beyond a strict examination of what you have done with regard to the 1998 budget.


Our guiding principle must be to create a truly level playing field on the competition front, through harmonisation and by taking comparable cost components into account.
It is time that the citizens of Europe received detailed answers to the questions of the effect on safety and the environment of the falsification of data in the MOX facility at the BNFL Sellafield site - falsification that has been ongoing for some years - because of the seriousness of the questions it raises for the safety of MOX fuel in use and for the nuclear installation's safety generally.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Amendment No 39 by mistake.
My group calls upon the existing railway undertakings - and I see one is represented up on the platform, for which I am grateful - to take the necessary precautions now, so that they are in a position to make use of the new provisions when the European law that we are now in the process of adopting has to be transposed in the year 2003.

It is up to governments to demonstrate to the public in their countries the absurdity of terrorism and to attack it root and branch by means of a multifaceted intervention strategy.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
One observation is unavoidable: Europe has unparalleled potential for economic and social progress which, for reasons that still partly escape us, remains largely unexploited, hence the highly interesting suggestions made in the initial report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to regenerate economic activity by setting ambitious goals (an employment rate of 75%, an upturn in growth, etc.) and by setting aside sufficient resources to achieve this.


That is the reality of the situation.

On Mr Lannoye' s initiative, this House rightly adopted at first reading an amendment specifying the obligation to place, on the front of the product, clearly legible wording indicating the presence of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter.






Particularly important are going to be the employment consequences already seen and I tried hard to obtain a balance: not to be too alarmist because, of course, some of these changes will mean unemployment, but, on the other hand, to look at the opportunities for new sorts of work that the changes will bring.



That is very important work, it is already scheduled and we must work as quickly as possible so that the maximum number of questions can be answered.

Plus, animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money.


Does it refer to where the animal was born or where it was fattened, or both, and who is responsible for labelling here?
Progressiveness cannot only be based on expenditure.
First of all, there is the question of partnership, particularly the place given to NGOs.
For several months, the European Union has been treading an extremely complicated path, punctuated by the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils and tomorrow by the Feira Council, to try to put in place what is called a 'common European security and defence policy' .

There needs to be a sensible and sensitive partnership in the external field between the institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament, and its Member States.

Rather we need to explain more clearly to civil society - whether NGOs, local authorities or other groups - that our programmes are open to their participation and they only need to organise themselves to respond to our calls for proposals.

Madam President, it is the case that, although the United Kingdom electoral system is a list system, the names of those on the list appear in the order in which electors are invited to vote for them.
Most welcome is the fact that the Council has made poverty alleviation a top priority. This should strengthen the partnership between South Africa and Europe.

A universal service points the right way, but the idea should not be implemented by providers which censor the Internet by using technical devices to deny their customers access to parts of the Net.

In a way, that much is recognised in the current proposals.

That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.


The Republic of Europe remains to be built: let us hope that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is still at the drafting stage, will constitute the first act and the cornerstone of that Europe.

wait for it...
We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now.
The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments.

Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?

It is not yet too late, but we must all realise that 2001 will be crucial in our efforts to involve the entire European population in this giant operation.

so if anyone cares that's how I fixed




Moreover, we are still waiting for a long-term vision for this programme.
It is good that the Council supports the resolution on the death penalty and on the rights of the child and of women.

I think that they face the challenge of achieving cross-border coordination of their work during the course of integration.
All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself.

The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.

They had 607 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere between 1949 and 1990.
We know and admit that this subject was not quite so urgent at first reading but there are now problems here for procedural reasons.

A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.

Above all, we need to recognise that the equal opportunities deficit in the labour market is partly attributable to the low proportion of women in Europe's businesses, in its trade unions and in its public sector, and partly attributable to an inadequate social infrastructure, distorted stereotypes and low pay.

Whether or not Turkey will join may therefore depend largely on how it will fare in matters pertaining to human rights, democracy and the protection of minorities.

Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.
However, I also think that the way these issues are being raised in this House, and the way these reports are helping us to reflect on these problems, represent a shake-up in our collective thinking and are an important factor in helping us to further intensify the debate on these issues. This is a task not just for governments, but also for non-governmental organisations, for social lobbies and for political lobbies.
In reality, the legal basis selected in the French initiative proves that the main aim of this initiative is to harmonise conditions for issuing long-stay visas by bringing them into line with uniform short-stay visas.


Mr President, as the European Union assumes new powers we might expect that transparency in this matter and parliamentarian monitoring would increase at the same rate.

What I want in my report - and I would like to thank my fellow MEPs who have helped in the drafting, as well as predecessors who have worked on this dossier - is four things.
It is not just a question of establishing longest permitted working times but of a good deal else besides.

The conference adopted conclusions and recommendations that are being actively followed up.
What is the point of limiting the number of MEPs, despite the increase in the number of Member States of the European Union, if not to silence those voices which criticise capitalist forces and their plans and promote political processes which brook no alternatives and which are confined to vapid changes of power which pose no threat to capitalism?

compile the cannon back end first
The EU is its biggest trading partner. In 1998 we imported 45% of its exports.
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.
That is something we must bear in mind if we are to avoid straying into misguided policies.
During the last few days, I have had the opportunity to talk to one of the girls who has escaped from the fields of Southern Sudan, who confirmed that the LRA has no intention of changing its position.
In this respect, I can see no major problems.

The new prospects for spreading information and enlarging the reading public via the Internet are accompanied by the problems of intellectual property and the status of authors and the risk of large swathes of the population being left with no access to the new media.




Without people farming in our villages and communities, there will be no rural communities; nobody left to service the needs of those of us that sometimes visit rural areas for recreation.
There are other points, such as public procurement, where the framework prohibits such criteria from creeping in, the issue of statistics, where I acknowledge and support your fear of a shortage of statistics - one of the basic objectives of the action programme is to create databases at European level - and finally, our obligation, as European institutions, to apply the same rules as those which we propose for the Member States.
Does the President-in-Office see such a threat as likely, and is there a need to protect Member States against it?
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.


In actual fact, of course, we do need to discuss human rights with China.
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.
Secondly, I must tell you that I greatly welcome your statements on the depleted uranium issue. In particular, I support your call for an urgent ban on the use of these lethal shells.
Mr President, the pioneers of the Internet saw the electronic highway as the ultimate means of communication and the road towards a new social order.
It is just as unacceptable to see families torn apart with children sometimes being left alone following the expulsion of their parents who have no right of residence, even though some have lived and worked in Europe for nearly ten years.




We will see how the point on the agenda unfolds.

Thank you. Everyone is now clear on this.
However, it is not only the Centre' s responsibility, but also that of the respective Member States to ensure that the information sent in is also relevant and can be used for some purpose.

This is an unequivocal signal to voters in the euro area to give the all too numerous Red-Green governments their marching orders, if they...

The Commission does not, therefore, recognise itself in the portrait that you might wish to paint of us, that is one of a nineteenth century dinosaur, or an even older one, if you prefer. We do not see ourselves in this light because, as you know, anthropologically speaking, dinosaurs no longer existed in the nineteenth century.

We are, as the honourable Member knows because he has been in this business much longer than I, actively involved in trying to develop an intellectually respectable case for preventative diplomacy, trying to pull together all the various non-military capacity headline goals which we think are required.

There are countless examples known to us of how victims have been treated in recent years: child abductions, in which case the parents and relatives are also the victims, victims of terrorist attacks, victims of organised crime, break-ins, robberies and the like, stalking, not to mention intimidation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I know, Commissioner Byrne, that serious action is being taken in a bid to make preventive consumer protection a permanent feature of EU policy.

Just as in the case of port we are not told 'South African counterfeit' , for cocoa we are not told 'counterfeit' .


Technology is developing and so too, therefore, must our instruments for the protection of human rights.


Because this time the reason the public could not be thrown into a panic was no longer to sell the Maastricht Treaty but the Treaty of Amsterdam.
That is why the Commission has made a series of sectorial studies of the forest industry and industries related to it.

The Commission is informed of the events surrounding the falsification of the pellet diameter data at the MOX demonstration facility and the BNFL Sellafield site.
With regard to the implementation and evaluation of this programme, the Commission has not exactly come up smelling of roses.


Efforts have already been made to rectify these shortcomings, mainly by adopting the first common strategies, but this does not alter the fact that the impact and credibility of European action fall well short of the resources implemented.
We have fortunately never gone in for quota systems for, if that were the case, I believe that men would have begun to take advantage of the fact.


First, on social security and the labour market, the report calls on the Commission, before the end of this year, to organise an international conference for the Member States and applicant countries concerning the position of frontier workers.


Re-legalisation would only further reward bad behaviour.

The text we are debating today certainly affects us more than most since it is about protecting children against sex tourism.

It will be presented - as you, President, have already presented it - as "nine years".
Under foreign policy, the European Council will in particular be debating the situation in the Western Balkans and the implementation of the common strategy towards Russia.

Mr Meijer, I would thank you and other Members for their creativity in coming up with solutions to this problem.

I would like to ask whether it is a question of the Chinese not being prepared to accord us the same negotiating status as they did the US representatives or why we should not be able to achieve consensus on the remaining - the tail end - 20%.
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party thinks that MEDIA Plus is an extremely commendable and important programme which can help strengthen cultural and linguistic diversity within the EU.
Mr President, first of all let me congratulate Mr Moscovici on his country winning Euro 2000.


The institutions cannot respond to enlargement by just adding an extra post here or an office there.
Accordingly, I am bound to contradict the assessment of the President-in-Office.

Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.
Here there is the basis of relatively good cooperation with the Government of Indonesia.

First of all, if we are in a knowledge-based society, we need growth in knowledge-based and creative skills.
Some members may have been won over by the arguments set out in the letter on the matter from His Excellency the Ambassador of Turkey, who again did us the honour of sending us what is now his customary letter in such cases, in which he stressed that the Turkish government was handling the matter with the utmost seriousness and that Parliament needed to leave superficialities to one side when dealing with matters as important as the prison system in Turkey.
The members of the Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats choose to abstain from voting on the legislative resolution because Amendment 6 to Article 2 has been adopted.


Pozac: why - does that break anything?



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.



In my country, the consumption of these is 6.5 kg per head annually and anyone who knows how these products are cooked can vouch for the fact that this is a very substantial amount.

Perhaps it needs pointing out that one sad case, the Omufuma case, was a case that a Socialist minister of the interior had to answer for.
Personally, I would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure, on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for non-accountable technocrats.
It gives no credit for the great achievements in race relations in EU states.

However, we fear that these proposals will fall on deaf ears.
We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments.



They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union's reputation.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who did, when all is said and done, put in a huge amount of work, having started by following the activities of the high-level working group on this subject, because it is an own-initiative report.
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.
In our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout Europe take action to deal with these matters.

ATI certainly doesn't have any


Mrs Rühle' s report on the various EDFs clearly confronts the Commission with its responsibilities; it demands more clarity for all future aid distributed by the Community for the benefit of developing countries.
Firstly, I will refer to our contribution to the international organisations.

You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.





The first is how the Commission handles the scientific advice available to it.
I am delighted that a delegation from our neighbours, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, is currently visiting Chechnya, and I wish to appeal to the Commissioner to travel to Georgia and Chechnya in the near future and have a close look at the human rights situation there on the spot, just as the Council of Europe is doing in such a thorough way.
Brussels does not want to be involved.

On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.
I hope that Amendment No 154, which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled regarding increased flexibility, will be adopted.


The LTTE has to be stopped.

In other words, Mr Barón Crespo, you will take over Amendment No 5, on behalf of your Group, pursuant to Rule 139 of the Rules of Procedure.

During production and afterwards, an adequate promotion and marketing budget is generally lacking.

I trust that Sweden will also actively pursue the goal of a more open decision-making process.

Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!
I am curious to see what the outcome of your position will be.

The three countries mentioned have all played an important and active part through their bilateral diplomatic relations with Belarus.

Mr President, the Commission report, which I have read in great detail, says: "In general terms Directive 92/85/EEC has been well implemented by the Member States and this is reflected in the low level of complaints about the rights of pregnant workers received by the Commission".
In this connection, let me once again thank the European Parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 Budget.
I see that our co-rapporteur is also requesting the floor.
One of them is the issue of Article 137(6) which, in my opinion, should be repealed.


Hauliers in the UK complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage, and that is true.
In terms of security and defence, with the fallacious argument of autonomy constantly being used and based on an effective concept of a politico-military block, dangerous routes are being taken towards the militarisation and reinforcement of the European power of NATO when this should be the time to definitively dismantle these blocks, to disarm and to cooperate in achieving lasting peace.

That is not a quotation from some irresponsible or lunatic left-winger.
The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions.
Mr President, once again we are discussing the situation in Chechnya.
Parliament has shown an active interest in this subject for some time.

The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future.
This would be a missed opportunity for us.
Last night in the Committee on Budgets when the refreshments were being distributed, Mr Colom pointed out that the small cartons of milk were marked "for distribution in schools only" .
Mr President, we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU raising taxes or imposing a new tax over and above the existing national taxes.
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?
Madam President, it would be a great help to many of us if we could vote on item IV first, for I believe there is a large majority in favour of our proposal under item IV.

Our task is to hand the earth and the environment over to future generations in as good a state as possible.

But once again simplifying the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be welcomed and therefore we will not be opposing this report.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Mann on her carefully prepared work and have great pleasure in supporting it.


This is the route we must follow in the future.

bborkk: a400 and a75 work..... not sure about SD300, but with a little luck canon uses the same protocol eveywhere
It was a clear case of extensive environmental damage, but do the other criteria apply too?

Can I ask the Commission to do what it can to reassure the Scottish islands, the Scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the Scottish Parliament, that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well, that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the Scottish islands.
Santa Maria da Feira European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000

Because of different historical background, legal framework, type and numbers of reactors and different approaches to regulation, they cannot easily be harmonised into a set of common rules.
aeruder: It's in the KDE Control Center, actually.
It obstructs competition between clubs as well as players' freedom of movement, it has done nothing to prevent the over-commercialisation of sport or the widening of the gulf between the rich clubs and those with limited financial resources, nor has it prevented players - especially the youngest players - from becoming targets of financial speculation.
This imbalance becomes more explosive with every passing day.
Getting closer.. the term is channel :)

The Commission has come under very strong criticism with regard to its media policy.



This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach. The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.

The longer this policy remains on the boil the more indigestible it is, not only for my country but also for the whole European Union.
How can wages be restricted 'in a spirit of fairness' when profits reveal unashamed exuberance?

Energy supply is more elastic than demand.
This is a recognisable aim which British Labour Members would support.

Madam President, I would like to point out that this House has on many occasions condemned the death penalty, and has also made representations to the United Nations requesting moratoria.


In our view, the latter condition has not been met regarding the admission of sodium alginate in peeled and sliced carrots. If consumers buy fresh carrots, they must be able to assume that these are untreated and not processed and they do not expect them to be dipped in a preservative.

I suggest that this week, as a matter of urgency, Commissioner Nielson be called to this House to explain the delay by the European Union in responding to a drought that has been continuing for the past three years.

If it is about what the honourable member said earlier, I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement.

Mr President, Commissioner, e-commerce offers the European Union a unique chance to stimulate economic growth, strengthen the industry' s competitiveness and create new jobs.
Aware of the unacceptability of discharging waste at sea and the behaviour of crews who profit from a dramatic accident to discharge their own waste with total impunity, thereby adding to the pollution of the seas, the European Commission proposed focussing its action on installing reception facilities for ship-generated waste in European ports.
Europe has indeed become highly productive, and would not otherwise be the world' s leading exporter.

Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.
We shall have to make do with the financial package established in Agenda 2000 and to deal with the enlargement of the Union.
As for the fight against illegal immigration, this House is hardly interested.


Mr Theonas wishes to rephrase his question.


I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her work.
We must understand that we have to endeavour to ensure that political conditionality and the strengthening of democracy in these countries are the key factors underpinning our action.







Mr Newton Dunn, I stand by my previous response.

Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.
In fact, you will be aware that public companies settle within a certain period, and this time limit means that it will no longer be possible for private companies who deal with the public sector to impose large, excessive burdens on public companies.





These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.


Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.
I think that the European Parliament also ought to speak out on this.

This report is beyond improvement and I warn the House not to continue making a fool of itself with such absurd reports, because the issue of anti-racism is too important to be used as the basis for some sort of ideological show battle.
So where ya from Jason?

I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.

The Commission submitted a working paper to the budgetary authority last year in which it made a comprehensive analysis of developments, broken down by sector and underlying factors, and suggested remedies.

I imagine that the Member who invited them did so in order to make them aware that we spend money on making the European citizens aware of the process of European integration.

Finally, I should like to close by saying that every SME in the European Union and millions of workers in small- and medium-sized commercial, handicraft and professional companies in the European Union will look towards us tomorrow, towards the plenary of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in the belief that a new day has dawned for them.

Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little, too late.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.

We want neither to play down nor sensationalise the problem. On the contrary, we need to exert constructive pressure and we see the decision as a chance, not a punishment.
What do we do about the Member States which are BSE-free?
In English we say "two heads are better than one" .

I therefore hope to receive more support for our amendment which was completely voted down in the Committee on Budgetary Control.


We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.
Political and social rights are being hit and individual rights and democratic freedoms are being trampled underfoot.
We cannot have it both ways.

It is obvious that we cannot interfere in the decisions of national parliaments. Nevertheless, we can and we must make representations to the governments of these countries, and I must say that the Portuguese Presidency intends, at the next informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on the Euro-Mediterranean process, to highlight the importance of making the parliaments of these countries aware of the need to ratify this agreement in particular, as well as other agreements which still remain to be ratified.

The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.


Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.

I would like also to extend warm thanks to the Commission, particularly for their declaration on working on Sundays.
That is why I, like one previous speaker already, advocate voting in favour of the rapporteur's Amendment No 11.



Does our purpose matter in the end, if the deed is the same?
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.
The European Parliament has gone even further, calling for cover for accidents which take place in non-EU countries, provided that the vehicles involved are registered in the EU.
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.
On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today: to vote in favour, to vote against or to abstain.
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.
Quite the opposite. We now have a considerable economic problem in coping with the clout of the American film industry.
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.

In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on.




nash, hoary's hotplug is much faster.
hmm, it will tough then :/
I do not believe that a great many of these MEPs are satisfied with the Commission' s economic administration, but we have reached a point where the majority prefer to close their eyes to what is going on than to run the risk of their electors and fellow citizens becoming fully aware of the scandalous states of affairs which make themselves felt year after year.



I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system.

It is difficult for the consumer to appreciate that equipment that is cheap to buy but an 'energy guzzler' will prove expensive in the course of time.

jblack, is there something I can do in case a merge --two-way fails with "PANIC: unable to fork for hook"?
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.
I would therefore ask whether it is once again necessary to make an application in connection with this matter. Given all the talk currently of the Commission doing something for citizens, might not, rather, the Commission be expected to take the initiative directly?


This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.
Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible.

This matter was signalled clearly at the Conference of Presidents last week - on more than one occasion, I understand.
The events have everything to do with the relationship between people and state in general and with the history of Fiji and the composition of its population in particular.
We must not lose sight of the consequences which such practices will have on the final user.


Fortunately, such profound questions are heard - officially and unofficially - within the candidate Member States.
Everyone accepts this, both the world of industry and the world of research, of course, in the same way as they accept multidisciplinarity, which is one of the results of scientific developments.

Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children?
We must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad.

With regard to the development budget, the cooperation between Mrs Rühle and ourselves was excellent.
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.
Safety provisions will require that conditions be such that safety can be guaranteed. This applies not only to the rolling stock but also to the fixed infrastructure.
It is just that if we continue at the pace of the Council of Ministers it will be a hundred years before we have public meetings for real.


I do not accept that this will simply be a one-off event.
They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge.

However, we consider very positive the amendments on the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union, so that they may participate as soon as possible in the achievement of the Union' s objectives - and we congratulate Mrs Davies on this initiative - and it also seems important to us that the action plans are of a local nature and that the possibilities for reducing ozone concentrations are studied on a case by case basis.
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.

We see that there are really three parts to the Danish initiative, plus the demand for ratification of the Council of Europe' s Convention.
The Court of Auditors has drafted a special report on this subject, which will be reflected in the 1999 discharge procedure.



This is being demonstrated across Europe by our fellow citizens all the more clearly because they have the greatest desire to protect their roots in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation.

The postal service is also the doctor.
What we are talking about here is really industrial processing of minced beef to make burgers and similar products, and nowadays that is a continuous industrial process.
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.

These amendments refer mainly to the modus operandi of the board of directors, the provision of technical assistance by the Centre to the aforementioned countries and the Centre's help with evaluation procedures at national, European and international level.
In addition to the positive aspects of summits such as these, I would also like to make room for some criticism.



I want us to discuss solidarity and to reach agreement on our political objectives.
My question to the Commissioner, which I hope that she will able to answer when she comes, is this: since we have not moved an exception to take account of these on-farm incinerators, is this the first time the European Commission has heard of this difficulty? Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers?
Surely the feeling of being European relates far more to cultural references than to economic and social data?


Mr Schulz, my family never accepted any German capo. This will not start with you! ...
I have to express amazement at the two speeches we have just heard, one from Mr Bushill-Matthews and the other from Mrs Villiers.
Let us not get into this argument.
As you know, it is not a question specific to this debate.

I am very pleased to be able to say that the Committee on Petitions has again shown its indispensability, especially at a time like this, when we wish to enhance the status of the ordinary citizen in the European Union.

We therefore wonder what lies behind this.
They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments.
miggumike: umask is the reverse of permissions so a umask of 000 = chmod 777, umask of 022 = chmod 755, etc.
We fight against extremism on both the left and the right, as well as against violence.
Attention should also be drawn to the need to adhere strictly to the principle of subsidiarity, in order to leave the Member States and, through them, the regions with genuine local driving forces for research centres in direct contact with the worlds of business and academia, the ability to define their own priorities and methodologies under their own responsibility.

It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.
And the chief executives and managers of the multinationals who make the important decisions displaying the callous disregard for the consequences would face the proposal of not only seeing their businesses maybe in some cases closed down because of heavy fines and seizure of assets and so on, but they themselves could face imprisonment.

Secondly, preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level.
Finally, pending the introduction of a harmonised instrument for cross-border protection of victims, the Member States themselves and the candidate countries, in conjunction with NGOs, will need to enhance the protection of victims.

This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men' s work more than women' s.
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.
Furthermore, if Article 7(4) was amended as proposed, the removal of the qualification of municipal waste as 'untreated' would be tantamount to prohibiting the co-incineration of certain sorted municipal waste such as paper, cardboard and so on which could not be recycled unless it was collected separately.
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter which I believe, as I am sure you will agree, rightly deserves to be dealt with as a matter of top priority by Parliament.

Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.



It is true that we currently spend USD 300 million per year on Africa, but, at the same time, Africa has a debt of USD 15 billion owed to the industrialised countries.
New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced.
This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria.


Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.



And to older people I would say: acquire a nice, inexpensive place to live in the autumn of your years.

That is why this debate today is extremely important, as is the parallel debate with the NGOs, so that we can gather as much information as possible and incorporate it in the position of the European Union in preparation for the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights.

It is certainly not quite the right time to contemplate this, as we will really have to have the courage to tell people that eight years have passed already since the present applicant countries were invited to join the European Union.
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.


What we see fully revealed here is the harvest of the dragon' s teeth sown by communism.


In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.
Proof that these conclusions were unanimously adopted lies in the fact that they were signed by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, another member of the Committee on Petitions from the European People' s Party, two members of the Socialist Group and I myself as draftsman of the opinion.

It has been clearly stated that the objective must be to reduce the error rate and I can only agree with this.
The Commission should draw up a report on the position of restorers in Member States with a view to structuring the restoration sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work.
We cannot vote on this point now.
That is why, despite the fact that we agree with many of the rapporteur' s findings, we disagree with his conclusion on the opening of inward processing arrangements, even on a provisional basis, precisely because we believe that, under present circumstances, provisional measures will turn into permanent measures and will exacerbate the situation.
The following concept must be taken into account.

Moreover, as other speakers have already pointed out, it is also an economic asset that is judged by its success.

In addition, the Commission has established, as an extension to the communication in hand, two channels for debate.


This solution, which benefits the more environmentally friendly vessels, would seem to be much fairer than an arbitrary reduction in favour of the vessels labelled as 'ecological' , (and what would be the criteria for this?) or a standard contribution for the use of the facilities applied indiscriminately: we therefore refuse to replace a charging system based on the nature of the waste with a blind charging policy based on the volume of vessels, regardless of their level of risk to the environment.


Mr Bushill-Matthews' s excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy contain criticism of experience to date.


We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.



Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.

Liberalization should apply to all energy sectors, particularly the nuclear sector where there are huge subsidies from some states.
Whereas the Council only talks about the market, the European Parliament highlights the economic interest for the Community of the production of these grain legumes.
I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement.
I would ask you to support this common position.


The aim of this working group would be to find mutually acceptable solutions for the transition period, without prejudice to the final outcome of the discussions currently taking place. Nor would they contravene the agreements which will remain in force until a final agreement is reached.
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise in three minutes the thoughts and feelings which naturally present themselves when one is to comment on such a broadly based and interesting initiative such as that which Mr Liikanen has prepared.

2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	macewan	lexhider: never had that while i used hoary
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.

Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?



I believe that, by affirming the indivisibility of fundamental rights, as this resolution does, or affirming their innovative nature, we are taking positive steps towards an improvement in the living conditions of the European citizens.
As with other programmes, the Commission has not looked into the consequences of a possible end to this programme, the implications for the continuity of actions already undertaken or for the situation affecting partner businesses and jobs.
The path we must take is quite clear, as it was decided in Tampere that formal extradition proceedings between Member States for those who have actually been sentenced must in future be abolished. The principle of mutual recognition of judgments should also apply to final judgments, but also to judgments prior to the trial stage itself.

I am referring to the famous repair clause, the spare parts clause: the complex, organic world of the automotive industry.


I therefore put it to you - and I voted for the motion - that the European Union should give a glass of milk to pensioners, as well as to students, on a daily basis.
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.

heh, i have one here now that i know what is up

Needless to say, services need to come first, because air-traffic control does not exist in isolation. It is a service to airline companies and its customers.
It was for this reason that it threw out at first reading the superfluous requirements about maturation times, much as chefs might have wanted them, and category of animal, which did nothing for traceability, added cost, and increased the disaffection of many Member States and of those who will have to implement this proposal.

I believe the Commission has undoubtedly submitted a somewhat overly prescriptive proposal with, in my opinion, some outmoded initiatives in terms of environmental policy.

But my purpose is to ask for calm reflection and consideration of the facts and the implications for us the human race, for our health and well-being, for the future of science and the health industry in Europe and, by no means least, for our spiritual well-being.
We are sceptical about demands for substantial increases in expenditure and bureaucratic activity and in the role of EC-funded NGOs.
This is the end of a process.
In the same context of the e-Europe initiative, as well as in the multiannual action plan on safer use of the Internet, the Commission plans to support a number of actions aimed at stimulating the use of the Internet and promoting security and confidence among the users.
I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further.
Mr President it is a measure of the effectiveness and importance of this legislation that even in the midst of a comprehensive series of reforms of race relations legislation in my own country, we have a situation where further improvements can be made.

I should appreciate a reaction from both honourable gentlemen who stayed behind during lunch.

It is important for the thread of the Lusaka peace process to be picked up quickly though, and for the inter-Congolese dialogue to be able to start, with the cooperation of all concerned.
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.
Will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the Parliament?
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.


We must not forget people with disabilities.

But despite the best of intentions, European cooperation is leaving a great deal to be desired.
There is no need to vote perhaps, if everyone agrees with this proposal to begin tomorrow at 8.30 a.m. and hold the votes at 11 a.m.


linux_mafia, oh I see, what I'm supposed to do in my case?
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.
We do not want a Community policy in the hands of the Commission, nor do we want the policy of another government: we want our people and their elected representatives to retain control over their own decisions and destiny.








My understanding is that the patent error can be corrected either by the patent owner applying to correct the document or by a third party filing an opposition which I understand has already been done.

It is up to us to construct this dialectic of European unity and its linguistic diversity.
For anyone who wants to change anything regarding monetary union or EMU, it is now, when the Treaty is being changed, that the opportunity exists.
Subject: Increase in Community budgetary resources Much time has been devoted so far at the Intergovernmental Conference to issues such as the need to revise the decision-taking procedure in the Council of Ministers and the number of Commissioners. Little attention has been paid, on the other hand, to the need for a substantive increase in Community budgetary resources so as to facilitate the process of enlargement and to enable the Union to address the increasingly difficult tasks facing it both domestically and in external policy.
I think it is useful to be on the same wavelength because, as regards women' s liberation, we could expect Europe to play some sort of a pioneering role.
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.


I should like to thank you, Mr Cushnahan, for your personal words of encouragement and for your congratulations following France' s success at Euro 2000 last Sunday.
Only the gods on Mount Olympus can say whether top-level sport is healthy or not - we certainly cannot.

In terms of the delay, is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids, or does the problem lie, as he partly indicated, with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application?
Naturally, I imagine, he must mean any country that does not belong to the European Union ....
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised. Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.


We have managed to increase our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance.

There is therefore a stranglehold on energy that does not just affect Moldova but also its neighbour, Ukraine; and Belarus, too, for that matter.
To speak of equality between men and women is hypocrisy.
And finally: if the forests do well, so will people.
. (IT) Madam President, the European Parliament is at last about to vote on the report, which has taken a great deal of time to prepare, on the drafting of the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I hope that the patient work of the rapporteurs will be rewarded in this Chamber.


We have to make the point as clearly as Commissioner Patten just did which means that we want those resources.
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.
The Commission, however, acknowledges that these amendments aim at addressing the possible problems that certain industries might face with strict time-limited consent.

Aside from any criticisms, the rapporteur puts forward practical proposals, which I support, such as extending the right of all non-EU nationals to vote and stand for local and European elections provided they have resided in the EU for more than five years.
Mr President, the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this Parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly.
On this matter it is important to ask you not to make the mistake of thinking that accepting a special lower standard of financial management for the CLONG is an adequate way by which the Commission should demonstrate its positive attitude towards the inclusion of civil society as such.


Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.

This now contains the very wording that we wanted on this point, and its other provisions are consistent and provide for practicable measures to improve air quality in Europe.
This took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which I just mentioned.

Prevention is central to a successful long-term national, international and global response to Aids.
With increasing age, you also become more aware of what it is you would like to learn.
This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors, especially in relation to imported goods.



By uniting the actions of debtors and creditors in a global strategy aimed at the elimination of poverty, it is possible that we will achieve objective 15 of the Copenhagen Summit on social development, which is an objective which we fully identify with.
Decisive importance in this may probably be ascribed to the new feeling of commitment to Europe, which I understand as a Europe-wide system of human ties, cooperation, solidarity, respect and other values.

Turning now, Mr Bautista, to the issue of black spots, which was raised by the Greens, I believe that it is important for us to keep an eye on what happens.



tuggy1, it's an X-Chat plugin

More than 10 years ago, the European Parliament introduced the first generation of catalytic converters and, two years ago, the second generation of catalytic converters appeared in the Langen/Hautala report on the motor oil programme.

We are familiar with the pattern from many national parties which have distanced themselves from the electorate and instead allow themselves to be financed by the State, business and the unions.

I would propose on behalf of colleagues that we have immediate resuscitation equipment here in the Chamber in case such a distressing event occurs again.

Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy, in a debate such as this, to differentiate between those aspects of our policy which we normally raise in the broad guidelines for economic policies, the stability and growth pacts or the references to the convergence reports, which will be the subject of the third debate this morning.


I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.
Mr President, I taste sweet victory for British chocolate producers in our vote today in their fight to have good British chocolate recognised across Europe as the delicious, high-quality product that it is.
This also has to be said in such a debate.
These two amendments are very similar to those which were rejected in committee.


Faced with the American steamroller, you commit yourself to doing your utmost to subdue and eliminate transatlantic disputes, in the name of a hypothetical partnership between the global superpower and a Europe afflicted with lack of vision, purposefully induced by incessant lobbying from quarters such as the RT.
I agree with this criticism, despite the fact that, as chairman of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I risk receiving yet another protest letter from Beijing asking whether the European Parliament is waging a hostile campaign against China.


This is not, however, an absolute right of the third-country citizens who reside in the Union' s Member States, and reside there lawfully.



Europe must be more forceful in the fight against doping, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is growing very rapidly and is no longer confined to the world of sport: the spread of this scourge has led to an increase in highly lucrative illegal activities, in which many criminal organisations have been involved, and we need to recognise that entrusting the fight against doping solely to sporting organisations has been a complete failure.


In fact, Tunisia is the first country with which the European Union signed an Association Agreement within the context of the 1995 Barcelona Process.


The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.
Prevention works, but it takes time.

What is intended through these measures?
The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned.
We are happy to accept the new appointments within the Commission, in particular that of the Secretary-General.

Admittedly, an exception is made but then this exception accommodates further exceptions.
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.

The growing number of grievances is an indication that the public have found him, and we members of the European Parliament have often been able to guide people in his direction to have their problems solved.

It has now become a daily scene at airports to see every passage-way overcrowded with bored, irritable or even aggressive passengers.
The Member States have spent similar amounts.
I should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can cope with fluctuations in the trade cycle.

If we do not, nobody will understand or forgive us for not realising our aim.

The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.

Only, irrespective of whether these results are positive or less than positive, as I see it, it is imperative that we - and we must never forget this - convince smokers of their importance, with a view to encouraging them to buy cigarettes that meet these requirements.
Categories have already been compulsory in the Community for 20 years as far as whole carcasses are concerned.


The figure of 31 million tonnes in 1990 has been mentioned.

Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.
Finally, I would like to ask your attention for the victims of these conflicts, namely the ordinary citizens.
Mr President, I will end as I began: this House must state loud and clear that the most important element of respecting human rights is the defence of the exercise of those rights - in full - in all cases and particularly in the face of those forces and organisations which hinder freedom of expression.
This report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with the first report sent to us by OLAF and I would like to thank Mr Bösch for the excellent work he has presented to us.
There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns.



For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided.
In particular, the high-level waste tanks pose a serious, on-going risk to the east coast of Ireland because of the risk of a release of large amounts of radiation should the cooling tanks overheat.
pozac: sudo apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade didn't help


As you know, the Special European Council held in Lisbon reiterated the strategic priority for the European Union of ensuring peace and stability in South-Eastern Europe and, as such, this is an issue which is on the EU' s immediate agenda and permanently on our political agenda.
Denmark ought to make use of this favourable position and complete the liberalisation, as has already happened in Sweden, for example.

Problem number three: clearly - and I am grateful to Mr Bösch for pointing this out - the findings of the Court of Auditors differ from those of the Commission as to the extent of financial irregularity which has occurred in relations between the agricultural budget and the Structural Funds.
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.

In conciliation could I ask you to make allowance for these farmers who have invested in cleaning up the environment by installing incinerators, and for whom the cost would be excessive should they not be able to continue.


Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.
The ECSC' s working method and public image are extremely dubious.


Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.
The fight against discrimination is an issue which has been on the agenda of the French Assembly since 1979. Two inquiries on racism have already been established and the French Parliament was the instigator in 1986 of a joint interinstitutional declaration.

BuckyG, add it to /etc/modules
Older children are at risk of being continuously pursued on the net and of being recognised for ever and a day.

It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.



However, in this case, we should not cite the precedent of Mr Tapie for two reasons: firstly, he was ineligible for reasons of bankruptcy, and, secondly - and this is important - he had used his right to appeal.

So our continent will have to rethink its rules rather than simply tidy them up.



I would kindly request a little attention and organisation in relation to annual planning.

Is it not disgraceful that they are having to attract people from countries where those skills are needed?
For example, the Member States have not transposed the habitats directive into national legislation.
****************************************************

As you know, today' s debate is rather special because it will be immediately followed by addresses by the Speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council who are here in Strasbourg and will be joining us in the gallery shortly.


The rest - EUR 3.2bn - over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous.

In the Budget, appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous 12.2 %.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.
The structures are superb, we can all agree on that.
I believe - for environmental and competition reasons as well as on the basis of the decisions made two months ago, in January - that we should adopt these amendments tomorrow, in the form in which we debated them in the committee, with a broad majority.
This is true in the sense that Lisbon is too close to the presentation of the broad guidelines and the bulk of the work had been done previously.


Mr President, laundered money is the reward for organised crime and political corruption.


Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, since 1979, fifteen Jews have been executed in Iran. The charge was espionage, but their real crime was being Jewish.
In this situation it is to be hoped that the Commission will be able to make the Moroccan authorities understand that the association can only be based on reciprocity, and that, if necessary, it will be able to adopt suitable measures.
In compliance with the Danish opt out in the legal sphere, we have abstained from voting in the final vote in view of the chosen legal base for the regulation.


This is clearly a cross-sector issue, which deserves to be dealt with by a special temporary committee, which has the task of calling in experts and of holding hearings of opposing views so that we can have an objective debate, which is not skewed in advance by deeply-embedded prejudices.
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.




What happens in another part of the world affects us.



On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.


- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.


I have a couple of questions, Commissioner.


I myself cannot imagine being able to participate in the completion of any greater or more important task in the whole of my political life.
I also want to remind colleagues that the amendments now proposed are new and therefore not based on the position Parliament took at first reading.

Finally, radical decisions are sometimes mainly based on opinions presented by biologists.

The debate is indeed going to take place as scheduled on the agenda and, like everyone in the House, I appreciate its importance.
As regards the second dimension, the technical dimension, I agree with the EPP Group that there is no need for a new structure and I agree with all the others who say there is a need for a lightweight and flexible mechanism.

The rules of the agreement on which we have voted go even further than those of the NAFTA agreement.
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.

We belong together, even when there are problems.


This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.
Mr President, when we learned a few months ago that thirteen Iranian Jews had been imprisoned a year earlier, we were concerned for their fate. At that time, in an effort to reassure us, the Iranian Government told us it was not a racist trial because many Moslems had also been arrested and indicted on the same charge along with the thirteen Jews.
I said yesterday that the Commission would be holding discussions this week, and I hope it is not presuming on its collective wisdom to say that we will be able to publish our proposals later this week.
crimsun, thats the one
I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market.


That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.
There is no miracle cure, but there are battles to be fought.
Mr President, and I would have been very surprised if you had not been the one to chair this sitting again.
32bit apps on ppc are usually faster.

Irrespective of their political complexion, present-day EU governments have, however, made the adaptation to EMU their priority, rather than welfare and the fight against unemployment.

What has happened since the well and truly hysterical dramatisation of the crisis in most of our Member States will surely do nothing to motivate young people to remain in farming, let alone encourage them to see their future in rural areas, where, as the report so admirably states, they have a very important role to perform in the social life of villages and rural communities, promoting and maintaining the countryside and contributing to the economic, social and environmental needs of the community,
rwabel: its a known issue.....
We know today that there are numerous cases of leukaemia.
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.

Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.
For that reason I fail to understand the misgivings that have been voiced, particularly with regard to small and medium-sized businesses, because it is precisely those firms which have the least onerous obligations in this respect.

It is a question of equality and solidarity.

We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.
rhodan, what file do you have? tar.gz or tar.bz2 ?

So we should be open to these possibilities.

However Member States are prepared to accept virtually any measure to ensure that beef is now safe.
I believe that this amendment would raise similar difficulties in law.

I also think that we must work together on specific proposals, such as the timetable for their implementation that you requested, including the regulation implementing Eurodac, which must be completed by the end of the year, in response to Mr Pirker' s question.
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.

In response to that, if this particular amendment is withdrawn by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, having regard to what I have said here this afternoon, then it is also true to say that the procedure will be shortened and this matter can be dealt with on first reading.


Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.

You are concerned at the shortcomings in the way these principles are being implemented and I would say that such shortcomings will have to be rectified.
The Member States will, of course, be very interested to peruse the experts' report when it is published, which, according to my information, should be very soon.

If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.



The results obtained so far are encouraging.
It has shown that it has the power to encourage disabled athletes to succeed.
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.
Blackwell: ubuntu is debian......
Mr President, with regard to the previous questions, I think that when it comes to agriculture, the actions of the Portuguese Presidency are sufficiently eloquent to have answered the honourable Member' s question - even in his absence.
I should therefore like, here today, to ask the Commission' s representative a number of questions.

At the moment, unfortunately, the problem of climate change is absolutely out of control.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European public' s need for information is still very great, although monetary union is already in place and euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation before too very long.
From the earliest stages in the bovine TB eradication scheme, the Department of Agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing, and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably.
Let me also take this opportunity to support him when he says that the financial resources for developing the trans-European networks are no longer adequate.

I therefore call for all possible steps to be taken to ensure that the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people is recognised, if necessary through the cooling of relations with Morocco, which, moreover, has already spent too much money fighting this principle.




However we are dealing here with transboundary pollution, so the Commission considers that adjustments to ceilings for individual Member States can only be made as part of a general review of ceilings.
we could do nl.ubuntulinux.org etc very easily

Furthermore, the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved.


Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 propose the reduction of noise thresholds by 2 decibels.


Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.

The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:



We would start by pointing out that, as far as we are concerned, the matter is not technical, it is highly political.
So, in small measures and not in large - because the United States must take the lead in these matters - the European Union can play a role, but it should not exaggerate its importance.

Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.





Precisely to avoid sport being reduced to nothing more than a business, we must call, loud and clear, upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference at Nice to expressly insert a significant reference to the institutional recognition of sport into Article 151 of the Treaty.


We have to bear in mind that this will have some effects on the visibility of our European efforts.
Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses.
But the old legal system is still there.
It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed.


In spite of our having discussed this many times, misunderstandings may of course arise.


What lies behind the incident at Dover, however, is that we have to recognise the inability that Europe has shown to date to fully understand the phenomenon of an ageing population. What this means is that Europe must have its own immigration policy and also the ability to work together on this immigration policy with the home countries of those who wish to come and work in Europe.
The sentences ended the second so-called "dirty war" trial and added weight to allegations that a dirty war, sponsored by the former Socialist government of Filipe González, was waged in the early 1980s.

However, I would like to say that the subject of Cambodia very much demonstrates the importance of our topical and urgent debates.

Indeed there would be a great deal to say about the attitude of some delegations within the Council.
It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage.
As such, they do not implicate the institutions of the European Union and, consequently, the Council is not justified in declaring an opinion on whether or not they should be maintained.

But this does not mean that the report' s observations should not be taken into account in future, particularly in Kosovo, in order to avoid similar problems arising with identical actions promoted by the Union.
Odd.
In my opinion, it is especially important to encourage Member States to develop sound methods for assessment in education, bearing in mind that self-assessment is complementary to external evaluation.
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.





(especially monodevelop)
Development measures are being introduced in the northern area of Morocco, which are starting to improve this situation and the economic conditions that have led to these migratory flows.




That said, it is true that your comment makes good sense and I think the Bureau will have to give it the fullest consideration.
But the idea of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises which is contained in Amendment No 3 is very positive.
In England, the connection of the high-speed link which runs through the Channel Tunnel has been in the doldrums for many years as a result of the privatisation and the splitting up of the railway companies in that country.

These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built.
Episodes such as the Gulf War and the proscription of Libya, and even of Syria from the international arena, in which we were skilfully manipulated by Washington, were just the most recent illustrations.

If there are no rapid improvements, I fear that the Commission' s support for development cooperation will gradually disappear.

Mr President, Commissioner, the present initiative is important for the purpose of making decision makers in general more aware of developments, but also because levels of development differ very greatly from one European country to another.

That is what we all say, but none of us does anything.

That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us.
I also think that the recommendation that coordination should take place within the framework of the strategies selected by the target countries themselves is a healthy approach to the issue.
To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water.
I will remind you though that most of the EUR 1 billion, which is the EU' s contribution to the HIPC II initiative, will be directed towards Africa.

There needs to be a list of rights which will be directly upheld by the courts, but there also needs to be another list of general rights which the Community institutions and others will have to take into account when drafting policies; some in the Court, some simply as background forming a valuable basis when we are taking other decisions.


In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we will only overcome the current crisis through coherent strategies which are well coordinated and multi-faceted.

We all have concerns that Plan Colombia might escalate the conflict and increase the influence of the guerrillas out there.

This subject is obviously a delicate one, and its development has been discussed at great length over the years, with many rules being regularly revised, but what we cannot accept is that the revision of these rules and the development of the bureaucracy always hit the most needy.

There will always be people out to abuse the system.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I consider this regulation extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been calling for an improvement in aviation safety since 1987.

We had initially heard that it was not possible to vote on the Valdivielso report because Commissioner Patten was not here.

However, something that can be acknowledged today is that, contrary to what used to happen in crisis situations, when Turkey was always tempted to use military power or to use extremist internal forces, thanks to the guidelines and the frameworks that were laid down in Helsinki, this strategy has contributed in Turkey to the consolidation of pro-European forces, which will, of course, have to develop a completely pro-European programme in terms of constitutional reform, political changes and new legislation.

2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	ogra	imka: it will !

It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.

In my own country, it is close on zero per cent, and I think that what we have noted in recent years in the EU' s accounts reflects the fact that common funds are not handled so carefully and meticulously as money which the States regard as their own.
Needless to say, we feel for the many Member States which struggle with inadequate staffing levels in their health sector.

I hope that others will also support these amendments.

First and foremost, both the Member States and the Commission need to update the regional development programmes and action to prevent, restore and reforest.
This requires additional support for the Member States with a less well established asylum system.
What I would like to address, before I look at the substance, is the question behind this question, - that is what we really have to look at here.


t

They are not allowed to bid for as much work as they want.







I believe we should stress the fact that the Finnish initiative was a very significant step forward from the moment it was put on the table, because it led the Council to get involved in a very urgent issue.
Trafficking in human beings is incredibly widespread in our countries because the demand exists and because the European Union is adept at showing itself to be a greedy customer, disdainful of the distress caused to these adults and children who have been denied any choice.

We can therefore now picture the enormous effort before Europe - the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow - in the process of constructing new infrastructure, the effort of involving private capital in this operation as well, which would not be possible if we do not succeed in identifying this situation.

The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.

And now the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has arrived at the same conclusion.
In my opinion, we should raise the standard for ourselves.
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment. Even in the tourism industry.
Allow me to say a few words on the overall increase in the size of the budget.




These violations, against which there is no possible appeal, have been recorded in the Russian Federation (in relation to Chechnya), in Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Colombia, Iran and Iraq, in Palestinian territories occupied by Israel and in Turkey, amongst other places. I could go on and on.
That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House.

Mr President, the Commission is appreciative of the rapporteur's excellent work and welcomes the recommendation on the Council common position which reflects Parliament's commitment to assist the new South Africa.

Mr President, I voted against this document because I feel that there has been too much hypocrisy at play in this issue.
I should also like to refer to the law we have passed in Finland which stipulates that the fee ought not to depend upon how much waste the vessel leaves at the port.
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights



I would, however, like to remind you of my desire to verify the reality of this additionality and I would also like to say - as I have said to several Member States - that the verification of this principle, the reality of additionality will be a criterion for the admissibility and approval of new programmes.
Mr President, doping is symptomatic of the inverted values of our societies, in which the end has come to justify the means.

Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
It is definitely so that when the fines are small, environmental crime becomes lucrative.

The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights totally rejects this Finnish initiative however, and, in so doing, shows a tendency to exaggerate.

I hope very much that Parliament will support it, and I will come back to that.

A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe' s fortification mechanism, but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect, which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level.



As it is, given that this directive imposes strict technical, legal and operational restrictions on all incineration and co-incineration processes across Europe, it will become more obvious that the strategy being pursued in Portugal is deeply flawed.
It is in practice that a Member State demonstrates at home if it is being innovative or if it is hiding with an innocent expression behind the EU.


The situation is far from perfect, of course.

Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.

Council Regulation No 2088/92 provides for the Commission to set up and administer a register of certificates of specific character. Under this regulation, producers of chocolate without the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter can apply for a certificate of specific character (guaranteed traditional speciality) so that it can be recognised as a food product made from traditional raw materials.
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.
More information is required in this area.

Therefore, it is absolutely essential for this amended Community regulation to come into force first, because this will rule out any conflict.


It is debatable whether this directive, for which I was the rapporteur, is in fact a suitable tool for managing the problems involved.


Only those who provide exciting content for a large number of viewers are taken notice of.
Furthermore, I share the rapporteur' s satisfaction in noting that the ECB has stood by its commitment to publish information regularly on the financial variables in its possession, the economic forecasts and the econometric models used as the theoretical basis for the monetary policy it has implemented.
We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions.
A number of difficulties arise in this and I shall highlight half a dozen:
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.
Mr President, the fact that the EU observer mission has garnered great international acclaim reflects the fact that Mr Schori has done an excellent job in raising the profile of what we were doing there.

I therefore hope that we will be responsible enough to reach a point at which the debate can brought to a definitive conclusion without going down a path which none of us want to take and without laying ourselves open to criticism.

You know that the Community, and in this case the Commission, has considered the idea of a complete review of conditions in the sugar industry.

Unfortunately, we will then have to wait for the result of these checks.

Over the past few years, many European government leaders have presented their own people with the view that the European Union is becoming too powerful and too bureaucratic and is taking away too much national sovereignty.

Set targets were tabled on several occasions and, on balance, we welcomed the fact, and I personally was pleased, and that' s a rare occurrence, when you said, following the vote in Parliament, that you would not accept the proposals adopted by a majority in Parliament which we, I should add, had voted against.

In fact, the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor' s Department is unacceptable since this requires us to be effective immediately.





The fiscal and budgetary autonomy of the European Union rests on this, as does, to a certain extent, its political autonomy.

Mr President, the discussion here today is quite an interesting one; nonetheless, we should see to it that Turkey is judged in light of the clear-cut European criteria and that Greco-Turkish relations are not used as a fig leaf to mask a different reality.
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.
We also accept Amendments Nos 18 - in part - and 29, but we have difficulty in accepting Article 55, which seeks, for the purposes of compulsory implementation, to give extrajudicial dispute resolution the same status as authentic acts that have been recognised by a body which has public authority.
Similarly, Amendment No 6 speaks about young people and encouraging them to take part in youth programmes by not giving them the extra burden of visas.
We need to step up our efforts of coordination.
Unfortunately, I did not receive any answer to this question.
This concern on the part of the Commission would also apply to Amendment No 39, to which various Members have put their name.

These complications ought to be studied more closely.
Thank heavens, my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself.


jdub: i beg an apology


The report by the "group of wise men" and the decisions which will be taken will aim, on the pretext of combating unemployment, to sacrifice the rights paid for by workers with blood, sweat and tears on the alter of increased profits for the monopolies and "competition" , budgetary discipline and support for the euro.
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.
And where implementation is concerned, the Commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice.
It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction.



The Convention also has the advantage of not being limited in scope to the area of the EU but of operating in relation to almost the whole of the European continent.
The vote will take place at noon.
Let me now come to the specific issue of depleted uranium and the public concern about the possible health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium weapons in Kosovo and Bosnia for the local populations, as well as the international personnel serving, or who have served, in the region.

Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
It has to be recognised that late payment is the chief cause of the cases of insolvency threatening the survival of many firms, making them bankrupt, which translates into job losses.


Once European responsibilities are identified, they should in any event not be divided up and they should also be truly based on a European vision and European values which we share here in this Parliament.

On the other hand, I would also like to express my agreement with what Mr Kuckelkorn says in relation to the correlation established between pension systems which cover biometric risks.


2005-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	Crane	lol
We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth?
This is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market.
How are these distinguished from one another and where must I, as entrepreneur, submit the applications for my project ideas?
I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now.
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.


The public's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States.
As I explained at a recent symposium of the French National Assembly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is intended to serve, among other things, to put an even greater stranglehold on the peoples of Europe in relation to Community law and hence also in relation to the single currency.


Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.

Stem cell research would be a less tendentious title.
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner, while I have respect for Mrs Paciotti, I must begin by pointing out the ambiguity of her words.

The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.


Within the EU-Mediterranean framework and in reinforcing this framework as we are trying to do at the moment in close cooperation with the European Commission, we are also insisting on the importance of actively promoting the rule of law and the good management of public affairs which constitutes a key area in the dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean.
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.


Those who have voted to oppose family unity; to oppose encouragement for ethnic minorities to participate in elections; against a policy force that reflects Europe's diversity and against multi-ethnic parliaments are to be deplored and condemned.


Firstly: the Ludford report flouts and violates the underlying principle of subsidiarity by calling in points 4, 6, 27 second indent, 11 and 20 for measures such as the recruitment of third country nationals to public office or formal requirements to change curricula and teacher training programmes.
But this monitoring centre can only be a statistical instrument, and not even an objective one, in this class society.
However, full political citizenship must be acquired in accordance with the laws of each Member State.
The accession to power in Israel of Ehud Barak, who was elected on a platform of peace, and Yasser Arafat' s unstinting determination to keep the dialogue alive allowed the peace negotiations to resume, thereby helping to resolve the stalemate which had dogged the peace process for several years.


It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti.

The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30.

I think that this is a good strategy.
All possible resources must be used in order to assess the BSE situation in the various countries, particularly including the development and systematic use of fast screening tests.

Mr President, I regret causing some slight complications as regards the order of business of the plenary.

Where registration is required, what, in any case, is the difference between cattle which graze in the mountains and those which graze in valleys or in fields?


It does us credit, but alone it does not suffice.

We are engaged in politics and politics must have a sound basis.
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.

you see the two lines, right after that one that sayas "the next two lines"?
Incidentally, gatherings of people are dispersed by Israeli soldiers often enough.

It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.

Regarding the JEFV programme which has had the weakest take-up out of the three financial instruments of the Growth and Employment Initiative, the multi-annual programme for enterprises foresees a simplification of the scheme to enable SMEs' requests for financial contributions to be dealt with more quickly by the financial intermediaries and the Commission services.
CheatersRealm: APT - Advanced Package Management
I was quite shocked to read the rapporteur' s original report in which she proposed that all employees in European workplaces should be forced to carry electronic cards so as constantly to be monitored by the authorities.
It is just one example, but an excellent one, of how cooperation, not only financial but political, industrial and commercial, can pay very considerable dividends.

I cited the Treaty of Maastricht as an example of this, and not enlargement.


Anybody who may think that we have been too optimistic in this debate must understand that we are not starting from scratch.
The processing of spent fuel from 34 plants in 9 different countries was thrown into doubt and, indeed, Japan, Germany and Switzerland stopped sending material - and quite rightly so - to Sellafield.
We had, however, identified, for institutional reasons, with regard to extremely serious or sensitive issues, five categories of exceptions requiring unanimity.
We would emphasise not only the cooperation from the police which has fed into this report, but also the importance of contributions at all levels of society.
Some saw this as the 'Employment Summit' , others as the 'Summit for the Society of Innovation and Knowledge' .
Our own future will depend on the way we succeed in assisting the continent of Africa to emerge from poverty and chaos.









We will draft a recital which does not appear to restrict the Commission's right of initiative, for inclusion in our amended proposal.
Perhaps you will allow me to pass a few comments on what the various Members of this Parliament have said.
We also need to search our own hearts regarding public tenders.


That is what is impossible for the Spanish democrats to accept.

There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.

Within this concern, employment is linked to competitiveness.

The resolution indeed is silent on the key issue, which is the validity of the policy implemented in the former Yugoslavia.

They often have experience and knowledge to contribute to society.

This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.
fabbione: I do when he returns

We must understand that there are three stages of legislation - formulation, implementation, including transposition, and enforcement - and we have to see the process as a whole.
This could also apply to the extensions of the French high-speed links in England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany which are running under the names "Eurostar" and "Thalys".

Of course this will be followed by intensive debate.
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.
Not wanting any roll back and unable to achieve containment, European leaders are logically seeking to prevent these nomads from leaving their home countries.
I thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their collaboration and support, as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Thanks also to the Commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and I hope it will be open to our proposals.


These action plans have been drawn up by that Group and I must tell you that the Commission has more grounds for optimism today than it did three months ago, because we have managed to reach agreement with the Member States on measures for co-development that the Commission will have to implement under several Community policies, including those on human rights, economics and development aid. The Commission and the Member States have also reached agreement on measures to be adopted by Member States, with the five action plan countries.

There are some parts I do not like, such as for instance paragraph 13 which promotes tax coordination.






Guidelines will also have to be drawn up for harmonising the price observation criteria and processing the data gathered so as to ensure that maximum care is taken in comparing the situations of the different Member States.
This view bears witness to an understanding of the political constraints of the European Union in the Middle East.
This is why the Council welcomes the creation of a United Nations working party that is responsible for making general recommendations on the way in which UN sanctions can be made more effective, for example by better targeting them, and on the ways in which needless human suffering can be avoided.


We would be happy to vote.
Mr Clegg, the Commission acknowledges that the agreement on China' s accession to the WTO is an extremely important decision.
According to the text of this recommendation, environmental inspections will include: site visits; verification of self-monitoring by the operators of the controlled installations; checking the premises, the equipment and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site as well as the records kept by the operators.

Yes, but what use will it be to incorporate a Charter if the content is disappointing?
Government failings are the main issue; errors were noticed too late, decisions were taken too late and when decisions or bans were introduced, there were not properly controlled.
Timely, because I hope that before the summer break this equally new Commission will adopt a communication on human rights in external policies.
Furthermore, any proposed solutions must respect the national sovereignty of the Member States and restrict the centralisation of regulatory action to absolutely essential matters. Any proposed solutions must also safeguard the particular requirements of defence and the specific military needs of each country and honour the commitments that all countries have made in the framework of international organisations.



This cannot and should not be the case and we all know that national issues of e-money can no longer be guaranteed today, if we look at the wording of Article 8c in particular.
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.






We must create good legislation, which is balanced for everyone.
Therefore, in my opinion, we need to focus our efforts chiefly on protecting the indigenous ethnic groups, so that the indigenous Fijians do not share the fate of the South American Indians or the indigenous populations of Central and North America, and to ensure that their culture is preserved by controlling illegal immigration, so that what is happening there and has sadly already come about in the Balkans does not occur in Europe as well.
I believe this should be an important element in our coexistence.
The PPE-DE Group would like to limit the European Public Prosecutor' s mandate to the European institutions only, while we have just seen that most fraud takes place within the Member States. The PPE-DE Group had better have a good explanation for this.

The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.

Surely it is absolutely appalling that the governments of poverty-stricken countries such as Ethiopia and Eritrea buy arms on a massive scale instead of building up sufficient food reserves.

Basically, my problem is that I had questions down - as some other people did - to Commissioner Byrne.

The first, to which my colleague referred, is political dialogue.

By proposing these amendments, the Commission intended for the recording of taxes and social contributions within the ESA to be carried out according to equivalent methods and, therefore, that there be no differences in approach between the different national public administrations.
The third and last element consists of combating illegal immigration, and particularly criminal networks.
Granting EU financial aid to Turkey should be tied to solving the Kurdish problem, and this aid should be devoted to overcoming the economic and social underdevelopment of the Kurdish region.
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter. My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.
This cannot possibly be true, it is not true and I would argue that even the Members' speeches illustrate that it is not true.


This must be increased, decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and the participation of civilian societies must be utilised.

Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?
In this respect, I should like to make two firm requests on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I should have liked to present these as demands from Parliament but it is enough, today, for them to be firm requests.

All credit to Mr Doorn, who has managed to put his finger on the problem.


In this respect, we should consider a series of programmes for the future which will allow the new Members to achieve convergence with the European Union while, at the same time, the four countries which receive Cohesion funds should continue to receive them so that they can achieve the true objectives of convergence, growth and the generation of full employment.
Lastly, a final word on social cohesion.
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.
I do not understand the political interference and the real message from France, and we should get to the bottom of it.
Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing.
This is one step in the direction you suggested, and I hope that it will serve to improve relations between our two great institutions and also, of course, to clarify the development of the subjects under discussion.
Consequently, because there had been a substantial amendment, this required reconsultation of Parliament, i.e. we have had to review the situation, albeit only in respect of the relevant points, i.e. Articles 22 and 23 alone.
In fact, all it is doing is bringing itself and the European Union into disrepute and burdening European businesses with a layer of cost and bureaucracy that they can ill afford.

are there any problems installing kde on ubuntu?
It was never going to be easy to satisfy all of the interested parties who have lobbied and worked closely with the Union institutions to bring about amendments to the 1993 directive.

This is a serious breach of the humanitarian principle and is, in some cases, a fatal shortcoming which is responsible for many war victims.




I said from the outset that members' offices were off limits for OLAF.
I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line.

We are working to encourage the applicant states to apply the good practices in use in the European Union.


If they do not do so then, as others have already said, this will automatically mean asking the Commission to draw up legislation in this area which will at least prevent accidents from occurring as a result of pilots spending too long at the controls.
trukulo: hehe, cannot read it, but looks good. That is what I was looking for. Thank you.

This happened just recently, in the case of Kosovo, and Yugoslavia more generally.
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.



it is a media player
Mr President, the Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
And once again, Parliament responds to this by using an incoherent form of language whose repetition is discouraging.
We therefore hope that you will be receptive to this request because, otherwise, we should bear in mind that all the projects, all the development plans for the rail networks affected by these specifications, would be subject to difficult conditions, and this would have a negative effect, since it would create uncertainty in relation to the planned investment programmes themselves.
A sector constrained by a series of outdated, contradictory and often incomprehensible rules can only have very limited responsibility in this state of things, and yet it alone has to pay the price.

Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union, where we lag behind the United States.
The reason for this is that the present Commission, which has undertaken to implement an extensive administrative reform, is not showing sufficient willingness to implement this reform.
Mr President, first of all I thank the rapporteur for her splendid work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr Vatanen for his contribution, speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
These tasks are still mainly the responsibility of the Member States - whether it is the issue of education and training, and research, increased competition or removing barriers to entrepreneurship.
Our pressure has prompted the European Commission to undertake drastic reform in foreign policy.

But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.

I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.

I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.

Madam President, firstly I would like to say that, in any event, we are all aware that we are facing a situation in which we have to find our way with few specific points of reference and therefore, we must resort to analogy, precedent, common sense and, in general terms, the general principles of the law.





Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled?
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.
I think our ACP partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote.

Thank you for your kind words, Mr Bolkestein.

And the Union did in fact provide extensive aid from the start and will continue to do so in future.





I hope that you will agree with me that we are starting to make progress on improving implementation and if both the Commission and the European Parliament continue their efforts to highlight the problem and act on it, further progress will surely be made during this parliamentary term.




I was going to vote in favour of the motion given its positive points and the hopes to which certain points may legitimately give rise.
Since these instances of enlargement, a debate has begun on differentiated integration.
Following this there has been an interim agreement for sharing the waters of the Tista river and Indian assistance in preparing the project report on the proposed Ganges barrage which will be located on Bangladeshi territory.

So, with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health, as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost, what justification is left for nuclear processing?


If military equipment is increased in accordance with what Plan Colombia is proposing, it will clearly reach the paramilitaries.
If there is any change to the amount or distribution proposed in the proposal for a Council decision, both the Council and Parliament will be reconsulted.

The question is what will farmers and consumers do about this? Will they step up their fight?
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.


As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.

In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.


So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.
Thirdly, there are also the environmental benefits - the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles.

For some States, however, this sort of nine-year period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjustments.

It is an urgency which has been voted by this Parliament - so be it, but it is quite ludicrous.

As has been stated here, environmental considerations also powerfully advocate the development of the railways.



The tropical forests and their various functions and usefulness to humanity can contribute to a large extent to the achievement of the Union' s aims, not only in terms of development and the environment, but also with regard to its objectives of fighting poverty and sustainable economic and social development.


It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans.

This cult of the quantitative culminates in a grotesque comparison between the number of American and 'European' diplomats, the number of 'European' diplomats having been obtained by adding up the numbers of professional diplomats attached to the foreign services of our various countries.

We will be voting in favour of the tenor of the report and we are backing it.
The role of the European Parliament is to represent the people in the Union.

Let them also have the European Union' s full support, in the same way and to the same degree that the United States supports Israel.
The scale of the earthquake was considerable.

I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question.

On the one hand, people are saying that we are not talking about or aiming for a single diplomatic corps, but it is quite clear that the aim of this whole project is to have EU embassies abroad and to abolish national ones.

I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve.

It is true that there has been a lot of criticism of humanitarian aid.
I refer to Article 38 of the territorial requirement which restricts the scope to the territory of the State of Israel and thus does not grant special customs arrangements for products coming from the territories which were occupied by Israeli armed forces in June 1967 and upon which, in breach of all the international rules, from the fourth Geneva Convention onwards, the different Israeli governments have built settlements, confiscating Palestinian land and water and installing their own people.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.

Subsidiarity is, therefore, particularly applicable here.
What we are talking about here is, as it were, a ceterum censeo, which needs to be the subject of debate here in the House for all directives.

Since then, a long, and sometimes difficult, negotiation process has been taking place within the Council, which did not reach a common position until December 1999, and between the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself, in search of the necessary consensus. All this took place under the restrictions caused by the approval of a budget which imposed limitations in various respects, and in particular the need to allocate funding to implement the special plan for the reconstruction of Kosovo.

Commissioner Nielson also said something to that effect.


Whether or not the Charter is incorporated into the Treaty clearly depends on the work which the convention is able to carry out.


The Commission remains convinced of the crucial importance of making all the necessary efforts to support effective measures for the fight organised crime and is determined to develop, within this new framework, regional projects covering the field of justice and home affairs.

By this I mean that this is a well-worked, well-informed and studied document and we owe that firstly to Mr Costa and to the other speakers who have shown their great interest in such a thorny and difficult issue.

I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted, this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world.
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.



In closing, I feel I must congratulate the rapporteur on his comprehensive report and stress the fact that on the whole, the implementation of the programmes financed by the various funds was on the right track in 1998, the year covered by the report and a good year overall, in which the relative delays of previous years were recouped.

The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.



There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.
However, these concerns are the centre of attention not only for the Commission but also for the Council.

On the basis of these principles, the European Union must carefully assess the necessary response to this delicate situation resulting from the elections of 28 May.
A second disturbing phenomenon is that of trafficking in human beings.

I must point out that there is a whole string of outstanding and skilled stations broadcasting to foreign countries which have for many years, and to an ever greater extent, been transmitting high-quality, objective and valuable programming to these regions, and they have received European support for this.


In these circumstances, we cannot accept the instigation of this eco-tax.
Furthermore, air traffic problems are not discussed in the directive on ceilings for emissions which is under consideration.

It is the EU' s responsibility to contribute to this.
However, in the event that interest rates vary, and to the extent that the source of income is highly sensitive to interest rate differentials, the share of income accruing from interest could fall very quickly and even produce a loss.

This is currently something that we should be concerned about.

And I should like to say that the President-in-Office's "yes, but" stance worries me somewhat saying that the Council will continue to monitor developments, that there may have been some unfortunate incidents, but Turkey has given its assurances that nothing is amiss.
However, it is not just the current Council Presidency that I should like to thank, but also the previous one, the Portuguese Presidency, for creating a thoroughly cordial atmosphere despite all the differences of opinion.

Nonetheless, I must ensure that this level of safety also applies to Italy, Germany and all the other countries in the European Union.
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.

Perhaps Commission staff could be reassigned.

It is probably fair to criticise this convention for its vagueness on a number of points, but in Article 18, it states quite clearly that the production of human embryos for research purposes is prohibited.

It is perfectly appropriate to make her an apology in writing.
The main victims of conflicts - children, women and the population in general - are the first to be threatened and to suffer and we must make their protection one of the priority objectives of our action.

(FI) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to draw attention to the economic effects this legal decision will have.
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.
This certainly increased administrative expenditure considerably, but largely failed to achieve the desired, and necessary, effect: subsidy-hunting continued and the area under cultivation increased from around 100 000 hectares to 240 000 hectares, with the result that budgetary expenditure on this sector was, virtually, more than doubled.


There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.
Thirdly - and this is closely related to the previous point - the budget for humanitarian aid must be increased proportionally with its political importance and the real objectives we wish to achieve and which can be counted in the most important terms: human lives.
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.
Mr President, my last point concerns the European Parliament itself.
Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of death among children and young people.



The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.


Not only do they deserve our respect, but also all the European support we can provide.



Mr President-in-Office, could I ask you once more to act upon the resolutions which this Parliament has adopted three times and may I ask you what you intend to do?

Based on this budgetary agreement, which includes an agreement on dates, the differences have focused on aspects of comitology derived from the historic positions of Parliament and the Council itself that, with a view to the future, in my opinion - and not to insist on the problems made manifest in Mr Wijkman's intervention - I believe that they should be revised in an interinstitutional agreement in order to speed up the parliamentary legislative procedure and make it more efficient.

That will not have strengthened our case.



The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.
But where we want to network Europe in the long term, especially with the future Member States of the Union, things do not look any better.


Will the matter be placed on the agenda for the IGC?

High infant mortality, decreasing life expectancy, increased incidence of cancer and treatable diseases, continue to devastate the social fabric of a country that once enjoyed a high standard of living.

I would be interested to hear about his trip and what he thinks of the criticism of the government?
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Evans on the quality and weight of his report.

We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.
I have even less appreciation for the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of discrimination on the basis of sex throughout the package which the Commission presented in November, as if the fight against this was done and dusted.
Should it take a favourable view, when would it expect to present an appropriate initiative?

And they usually refer to the habitats directive, the environmental impact directive, the wild birds directive and the right to information directive, which together with those discussed here today on nitrates and PCBs are probably the ones most often infringed.



Consequently, we believe that those Members - and there are many of them - who are writing reports, chairing committees, running groups and have legitimate reasons to be here should, on declaration of those objectives, be able to come and do their work in the place that they were elected to do it.

I propose that the Commission turn to the Council and the Member States to try to get them to contribute to such a fund.

The file, accompanied by a request for a `certificate of specific character´, was submitted by the whole virgin honey association and forwarded to the Commission by the Italian Ministry for the Environment on 8 September 1995.
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.


I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors, or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive.

I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.
Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government' s initiative. We support it because it is a serious initiative and because of its substance, both in terms of strategic objectives and in terms of other objectives with which we agree.

With reference to points 41 and 42, I appreciate the fact that no citizen, not even a male descendent of a former ruler, can be deprived of the freedom to enter the country of which he is a national, but I do not understand why this only applies to Italy and Austria: there are other Community States which have rulers and sons of rulers living abroad.
The Committee on Industry welcomes the European Commission' s intention of establishing a policy framework for future programmes and stresses that this framework must be developed after extensive and in-depth consultations between all the parties involved.

Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea.


Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.
This includes cheaper Internet access for all the citizens of Europe, which means fostering even more competition in local networks, for example by unbundling customer access.
We can discuss the issue of whether or not legislative decisions should be taken in public.


That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.


As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.


That concludes Questions to the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 500 days from now euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation.
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.

I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector, the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion, which is a considerable proportion of the budget.
Rules of Procedure were brushed aside so that we could proceed to the vote on the Buitenweg report, which bears the name of one of the leading lights of the group, whose spokesperson today is Mr Duff, perhaps because of some embarrassment on the part of Mrs Buitenweg.
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.

That is unacceptable in a democracy.
Clearly these are, shall we say, the most visible and most well-known feature of this process, but other important instruments are required such as preferential trade agreements, direct aid from the European Union and political dialogue.

Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.

The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.





We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.



The EU is the region' s superpower - economically, politically and militarily.



This is why the French Presidency has submitted a draft set of guidelines, which is designed to make the Commission' s work and the drawing up of a future directive easier.

Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?
Right, thank you for making that clear.

Commissioner, you must finally come clean as to why you are not envisaging that unpacked foodstuffs, in particular fruit and vegetables, should also be compulsorily labelled.
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.
Consequently, we within the liberal group would like, and this is the wish of Mr Watson, his committee to be able to effectively take control of the matter and we would like to have very clear information on whether the Austrian Government has infringed Article 10 of the Treaty, that is, whether or not it has fulfilled its obligations with regard to the Monitoring Centre.

(B5­0343/2000) by Mr Messner, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the issue of Tibet within the framework of the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;

I have considerable reservations about how this will work in practice, but we should welcome the principle that Mrs Lucas has put forward.


The Commission' s proposal aims to create equality through market liberalisation.

No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.


Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.

Without doubt, the only outcome of all the measures to implement the principles of free establishment and free provision of services, the measures to liberalise the markets, the measures to promote the free movement of goods and the numerous concomitant laws is to strengthen the huge multinationals whose potential to extend and mobilise on new markets at greatly reduced costs has been facilitated and which have benefited from deregulation measures. These multinationals have seen their profits increase and their position consolidated.

They cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity.

We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.
Aoi, are they the same type of card?

A number of national legislative systems do acknowledge the employees as creditors, but they are only, at best, entitled to the payment of their wages due.

One is the sensitivity it shows by specifically highlighting the fact that there are certain social groups - women, children, immigrants, homosexuals - who are more vulnerable than the rest of the population, as well as the fact that there are also certain sectors who, ignoring the most basic democratic principles, prefer to use violence to impose their objectives.

We think it is good that the directive is not just being extended to banks but also to other businesses or professions which might be abused for money laundering purposes, and here the problems associated with the liberal professions have been satisfactorily resolved in our view.

There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids.
The newer it is the greater this need is, and the more complex it is, the greater the need for better transparency.

They should be involved, and determine the framework and rules, but leave it to the Commission to implement the actual project.

B5-0060/2001 by Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the ratification of the Treaty of Rome to establish the International Criminal Court;
It is a serious matter that we should have this type of trade, because it is often not even adult women who are affected but near-children and very, very young people.
Quite obviously all victims should receive 100% compensation.
At Community level, this issue must still be discussed by the Member States as the process usually followed and known as the ad hoc Ecuador process is proving to be too tacit and, as such, is incompatible with the political and economic weight of China and with the specific importance of this particular case.
I have the distinct impression that the Committee on Petitions is considered the poor sister of Parliament and, in fact, at the end of the previous legislature its very future was in doubt.
Mr President, I believe that all of us are in agreement that the development of renewable energy sources is the way forward.
Let me start by noting that there are various definitions of the new economy.


The first concerns the legal bases and the financing.

There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country.

The mayor of one of the towns which has benefited wrote last week to his colleagues in the Serbian opposition making that point.
We must review the 1994 communication and update the approach to the questions of immigration policy in the Union in light of the Tampere conclusions.
This is why I must applaud the fact that this proposal aims at incorporating into Community legislation three NAFO recommendations on controlling activities of vessels of non-Contracting Parties, and in particular non-Contracting Parties whose activities are, without a shadow of a doubt, much more suspect than those of any Community fleet.
Is it really asking too much to want to check what the effects of this directive will be on, for example, export and the sustainable development of cocoa-producing countries?
Naturally, I wish to take this opportunity to say that I am sure the discussion between Mr Verheugen and the European Parliament, tomorrow, will make it possible to eliminate a number of misunderstandings.

but it's still beta
We should let the Commission prove that it applied the procedure correctly.
As far as the European Union is concerned, we hope that it will speak with one voice and assume a more pro-active role - and I particularly refer to a more pro-active role in the political field - and will thus contribute to the peace process.
By virtue of the Community patent regulation, patents delivered by the European Patent Office in Munich may become Community patents.

Apparently this is now in contravention of an EU directive, although there is a legal doubt about this.
In other words, an arrest warrant for a terrorist should take effect immediately without the need to go through the highly complex extradition process - which is still complicated between European States - so that the terrorist or criminal can be taken immediately to the State that wants them and where they have committed their crimes.
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.




In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.
I am persuaded that the European Commission ought to undertake to do more here than it has to date.



As it stands, this text does not allow the interests of consumers, small-scale chocolate makers or cocoa producers to be protected. It also does not guarantee the quality of chocolate.


I am aware that this is a very tricky business and that we must prevent any half-baked stories from getting into the papers.

Yesterday in Stockholm, I met a representative of the American Department of Agriculture, who did not take the European view of science.
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.

We all hope that it ends very soon.
As was to be expected, the Commission has just lent its support in the opinion tabled for the Intergovernmental Conference.

Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, a British nuclear submarine has been moored at its Gibraltar base since 19 May.
As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses.

Inflation has fallen over eight years from 18% to 2%, thanks to constant and unstinting effort.
There are currently no elements of policy coordination between the countries in Euro 11 which naturally affect or should affect their behaviour in Ecofin.
Topical and urgent matters are a very specific case.
Look at environmental concern as a driving force and not as a brake and as nostalgia for a time which has passed.
In view of the way this part of society and of the economy looks, it is even more important not to engage in a fever of regulation by controlling activities in every detail.
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.
We discussed and concluded this matter yesterday.


We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.


We have to examine situations case by case.



That is the task now before the Council.
I feel very strongly that such investment projects should be very carefully thought out with input from industry and bankers so that maximum jobs are created where they are needed and where there is wide coverage and public accountability and transparency.




B5-0088/2001 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on support for the peace process in Colombia.




Accordingly, instead of imposing blanket restrictions on some 15 000 square miles of the North Sea, I trust that it will opt for seasonal closures in areas where the cod concentration is high.
Where is the European Union not active?
International and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, to the North West Atlantic fisheries institutions, in which the EC participates.
We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case.
The fact that this information can only be requested for the preparation of verifications in situ in the process of the settlement of accounts sets a time limit on the availability of the fundamental information for administration and control.

We are now talking about implementation of the first stage in September 2000 and the second stage in September 2001.
Testing at 30 months remains the norm, but will be kept under review.
The present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike - they have our life in their hands.
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.


Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.

I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army.
On African elephants, we favour the maintenance of the status quo until a clear picture emerges of the impact of the international trade that was permitted in 1997.


Three conclusions can be drawn from this, to my mind. Firstly, we must wage a broadly-based communication campaign in the Member States and the candidate countries.



The second point is more specific.

I believe that it is clear that, in tackling the problems of noise, standards, tax on kerosene, etc, we should certainly at the present time opt for a worldwide approach.

Let me deal directly with the Commission's core proposal, the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone, not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year.
In this light, I would like to reopen the debate on corporate governance to discuss the wider concept of the company as stakeholders society, including the role of both sides of industry and all parties involved.



The Commission subsequently submitted draft proposals for decisions to the Joint EU/ACP Council and the EU Council which were adopted by the General Affairs Council on 6 December and by the Joint EU/ACP Council on 8 December.
If, for example, they want to implement the total extension of the definition of refugee or total access for asylum seekers to the job market or work to reverse the burden of proof, then the consensus achieved with their vote in committee will be jeopardised.
The Commission should submit proposals on project management, develop best practice methods, introduce benchmarks, on the basis of which it will be possible to examine how much time elapses between the first application and the successful creation of jobs. It also needs to monitor payment flows, and finally, promote the entire strategy in the public arena.
These have to be explained, not only to farmers, but to consumers as well.



Who knows where it will all end.
Report (A5-0397/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission report on the measures taken in the light of the observations of the European Parliament in its 1997 discharge resolution [COM(2000) 224 - C5-0223/2000 - 2000/2113(DEC)].

Book.
We support, Mr Byrne, the fact that you will have the opportunities which you need in the Commission in Brussels, for example via the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, that will enable you to carry out rapid inspections and take safeguard measures, so that we are actually able to say to consumers that we genuinely care about safe food, and safe feedingstuffs and animal nutrition inspections are the first step in all this.

we can get going right away with new members, on the basis that the cc were all there
We have thrown water a life-belt.

It is also for this reason that I would urge Parliament most strongly to support the report on school milk, because there is every reason to do so.
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.




If so, is there not a case for tightening up the code of conduct?

Parliament is already vast, the buildings are already packed and the whole thing has to remain workable.
Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, has also expressed the wish to make a communication on this subject matter.
In that way, Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam would really, of course, be revoked, that is to say if action were to be taken on the basis of national legal systems.

What we cannot have is Europe paying so little attention to education and the education funds being used for other purposes.

We propose that this should wait until six months after its publication, not only so as to enable operators to become fully conversant with the regulation, but also so as to enable the work that is currently under way on alternative means for dispute resolution to be concluded.
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.



Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Savary report follows the rationale of sustainable development.
This is by no means an enviable record.
With regard to classification, BSE status: I accept Amendments Nos 13, 14, 51 and 58.

But, for that, Europe would have to have an authority legitimate and clear-sighted enough to get out of the trap of all-out liberalism and, of course, it has no such authority worthy of the name.

At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.


2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	er, anir
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.
It takes the view, however, that the appropriate place for such clarification is not in an article of the regulation, and it is prepared to draft a new recital based on the gist of these amendments.


Mr Gollnisch, pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order?



This is what is happening in Zimbabwe.
It is therefore of utmost importance for Russia to join forces with international organisations for nuclear safety, and I would ask the Commissioner to press Russia to take responsibility and inspect the still active nuclear submarines, adapting them to better safety requirements if necessary.


Europeans are committed to their own currencies just as they are committed to their own values, their own nations, their own natural heritage sites, their own languages and their own cathedrals.
Secondly, we must have the courage to take the conclusions reached in 1998 a little further.
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.

for some reasons d-i installed a -smp kernel (=kabuum)
So it refers to both sexes and the numbers of women in decision-making centres cannot be increased unless the proportion of time which men spend on family matters is also increased.

We are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise, of course.
This is not unique to my nation.
To sum up, while the United States are negotiating with Indian universities for the best graduates in new technologies, Europe prefers to barter with the Taliban regime with a view to repatriating some of the women once persecuted there.

Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases, with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation, it is right that we have a review.


We have agreed that a study will be carried out which will also be linked in with a study commissioned by Mr Rothley into what exactly it is that the parliamentarians need in the way of support for their work.


I regret I cannot make it any clearer and I regret I cannot accede to your request: I would ask you again, in the light of what I have said about making myself available to your committee, to discuss the interaction between 152 and 37, and to give serious consideration to withdrawing this amendment yourself.


This, for us, is the crucial approach.
cef ;)



We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor.



But who do they think they are kidding when those self-same Heads of State that conducted the war are now causing living conditions everywhere to deteriorate and making employment less secure?
Unfortunately, this amendment was not adopted.
The report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light.
The reaction of the airlines is to ask why we are picking on them.
In essence, this proposal, tabled no less as a proposal by the European Parliament, which is supposed to represent the people, is intended to deprive Member States of the facility to exercise an independent foreign policy which differs from the choices made by the dominant circles in the European Union, to the detriment of the people.
noticied that my changes are in the undo directory
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.

We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.
In this regard, I would like to draw attention to an aspect of Sami Naïr' s report: the need to create strong initiatives in the fields of South-South trade and for subregional integration or integration in the southern Mediterranean region.

We are aware of the differences of opinion and the possible conflicts of responsibilities between external relations and development and therefore between the responsibilities of the individual Directorates-General, and possibly even between the responsibilities of the individual Commissioners, but we are also aware that, during restructuring, the responsibility for external relations is extremely carefully reviewed by yourself, in particular, Commissioner, and by the entire Commission.

The attitude adopted by some Member States towards the Austrian Government related to their negative perception of the new Austrian Government, which does not affect the Community framework.


You will forgive me if I am somewhat dubious about the use of these weapons in a country which, since 1948, has been devastated by a war sparked off by socio-economic reasons that are valid today, but which is increasingly becoming a war between the military-paramilitary alliance and the people.
If we were now to reduce fuel taxation generally, this would be very much like lowering the price of heroine on the drugs market.

They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose.

This again draws attention to the whole thrust of the policy and whether or not we should review it with the idea of making it more compatible with regional policy and with social policy.

These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.

To revoke this would be a retrograde step in social terms.
This is diametrically opposed to the opinion held by the Commission, which believes that fraud and irregularities occur far less in structural funds than they do in agricultural funds.


trukulo: but i have to tell the picture quality is not as good as XP pro


The financial interests of the Community also fall victim to organised crime, as the reports about combating fraud in the Commission show.


That foundation is clearly the single market.

I should like to end with just one reflection.



Nevertheless, I recognise this is a very sensitive question.

It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.

Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible.

On the other hand, I do not think that it can, or ought to be, implied that chocolate in which, for example, shea nuts are used as vegetable fat is necessarily of poorer quality than chocolate in which the vegetable fat used is cocoa butter.
These developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the Lisbon Special Summit, which considered that in Europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion.

As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the consensus-oriented cooperation which we have enjoyed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this sphere and add that we in this Parliament should break though the compartmentalisation and endeavour to rise above the hobbyhorses of this or the other side and to have an input in, for example, next month' s forum, precisely on that basis.


That is the reason for my report - to protect children, to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner.


Such a request must be made by at least 32 Members.
I now have another statement to make.


Much more serious, in our opinion, is an omission in recital D. It has a direct bearing on the very essence of Georgia' s political stability.
Some days ago, a number of ethnic Fijian Indians representing that community and the Indian diaspora who are concerned about these conflicts came to the Parliament.
I can only imagine a situation at a play school or a nursery school where the nursery teacher has to try to keep a check on which children are under and which are over three years of age as well as which children are allowed to put what in their mouths in accordance with all the experiments the Commission is trying to include.

Many citizens living in these areas believe that much more could be done to improve their situation and that is what they are demanding.
The important vote we will be holding tomorrow will, I hope, enable the European Parliament to put an end to this ambiguity and to make some adjustments.
So I plead with everybody, now there is a smoking area, to use it and not the no-smoking areas, including the corridors and going up to the lift.



I am also grateful for the support and confidence that Parliament has given the Commission on the implementation of this important Community Action Plan.
Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck.


Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?
I myself, together with many other people throughout Germany, condemn right-wing extremism and xenophobia, and we need the support of the rest of Europe in our fight against it.
And then two paragraphs later, the identification of the structural assistance interventions in the eligible regions is unreliable, and this leads to the inclusion of a large number of estimates and hypotheses which are difficult to verify.
I therefore intend to use this report as an opportunity to highlight the demand for a debate on competences after the Intergovernmental Conference.

The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions to the Commission by the following Members:
There, the border question is obviously central.
We will continue to gather information and hopefully be able to link all those concerned with this issue.
We want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect I thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for CO2 emissions from cars in Europe which applies to all Member States, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their CO2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers' undertakings are being respected or not.
In the Nordic countries, we obviously do not have the same problems as in the Mediterranean area.
hello thar

We would not want the same misfortune to befall you now, as the programme that you have presented to us is so exhilarating that it could energise Europe and provide it with the future alluded to by Mr Goebbels.

We have heard less about the hospitals and schools being destroyed and of torture by Sri Lankan government troops.


In this process, the Commission shall not prescribe any rules and is fulfilling its role as a catalyst.

can we agree on Ubuntite?
Mr President, we should all be in a position to sign the declaration.


I have consulted the services involved. They will take note of this and will make the necessary corrections.



In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.
Again in contrast to Mrs Grossetête, I want, moreover, to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic. They are technologically feasible and they are, in actual fact, already being applied in a number of the Member States.
Pozac, ok.
If I may digress slightly, I think the whole procedure is a good example of why the Council ought in future to meet in public. From Greece to Ireland and from Italy to Finland, our citizens would have been very interested in much of what was said there and would have thought, "What are our governments proposing here?
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.
Therefore, a number of them choose in the end perhaps to apply for citizenship in the new country. A number of surveys show, however, that, even for those who achieve their dream of returning home, it is very important that the period in exile should have been meaningful, that they should have had the opportunity to grow as people and that their qualifications should have been used so that they do not cease to develop as people and are not hindered from developing professionally in their own fields by stagnation, passivity, uncertainty and lack of qualifications.

Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.

By transferring the NAFO regulations as international law directly into Community law which is in force in all EU Member States, the regulation presently under discussion thus gains importance.

I know that in the short term it may be difficult to prove that but I am quite sure that in the long term this is a vital part of making our economies competitive in the wider world.


Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their interesting comments.


How does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations?
i shouldnt do that ? :)



we can add you to the list


For scientific reasons, phthalates have, in common with other toxic substances, been assigned limit values which give the highest recommended exposure level based on calculated risk levels.

In the end, it is a question of tolerance for one another and of respect for each nation's democratic process.
Mr President, negotiations within the OSPAR commission on issues coming under the Community competence are conducted, as you know, by the Commission in consultation with a committee of representatives of the Member States.


I shall repeat this proposal in my report and I think I can say that the Turkish Government is not hostile to this, but quite the opposite, it would seem.


This resolution reflected the desire of the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to break the deadlock over Mrs Stauner' s proposed report in the committee, but also in the European Parliament, which was putting our institution' s relations with the Commission onto a defiant footing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the banana regime of the European Union has already been condemned four times by the World Trade Organisation.



The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.

I should say in the context of the Blair House Agreement, my colleague, Franz Fischler is well aware of the demands of farmers to renegotiate the Blair House Agreement.
Many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat.
The European Parliament cannot and should not prescribe a harmonised euro taste.



rwabel: killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus trashapplet gnome-panel







The statistics bear this out, I am sorry to say.

I do not therefore intend to repeat arguments which I accept overall.
As you know, in the past all the Member States of the Union were authorised to provide special support for their film industries, particularly bearing in mind the specific need for cultural diversity within the European Union and because it was necessary to ensure that account was taken of this specific need, thus going beyond a purely economic view of the film industry.
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.



We think it is splendid that the trade agreement has had built into it a demand to promote democracy in Mexico - including the observance of human rights - but, as long as this demand is not followed up by concrete action, it is merely a case of empty words.

I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.
They will be required to establish sanctions; they will have to develop links with other Member States as well, in particular through a network of enforcement authorities of the Member States.
Equality has no pillar of its own.

ver
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.
It is an unusual process but one in which Parliament has to give the message from its consultation that the Brussels Convention must not merely be transformed into a regulation it has to be brought up-to-date to meet the needs of the contemporary world.
You talked specifically about VAT but I did not hear you mention two other taxes that have long been the subject of discussion, i.e. tax on interest and company tax.
The system has led to a tremendous amount of bureaucracy, an enormous increase in monitoring, and, in the long term, we can assume it will also lead to inefficiency and the entrepreneurial spirit of agriculture will vanish forever.
It is a "no, unless" , as you have pointed out correctly, in the event that the system is not operative before the judgement on adequacy is confirmed, if these amendments regarding compensation for moral damage or damage to property are implemented and if we do not establish a right to cancellation or a personal right to judicial claim.
I have also agreed to do this with the member of the PPE Group who works as a coordinator in our committee, since the PPE has proposed two amendments, although only for the legislative resolution.

We have the voluntary Supplementary Protocol against Child Soldiers and the Activities in Africa.
Similarly, reference to fattening methods should not be introduced.
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.
The Community Eco-management and Audit Scheme is not exactly the most popular of the environmental issues but, nevertheless, it is a fantastic instrument for making progress in the field of integrating economic activities and the preservation of the environment.

Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.
My own party was accused by a lot of left-wingers of racism because it spoke out on the issue of asylum-seekers in the United Kingdom.

Where internal borders are concerned, of course, we will probably not reintroduce fixed controls in the traditional form.


I would remind you that in this area, my country spent years, sometimes in relative isolation from the rest of the Community, trying to draw attention to the situation in Indonesia, and the success of that pressure was only measurable against the internal reaction and above all against action by the people of East Timor.
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.


The system is certainly very necessary, if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards.



pon, yes... i build on the desktop a launcher for pon. but i was not sure...wait a moment please...

This assessment certainly includes some positive aspects.

Both the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas' report provide guidelines as to how this can and must be done.

Mr President, according to the Commission proposal adopted by our rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, the main stated aim is to liberalise air transport further and make it subject to the rules of the free market.




That is the measure of the problem.
Here too, the question of uniform consumer protection arises.
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.
But we are determined to come up with a solution that can be considered with a broad consensus as a balanced solution.
I do not want to go into detail, but people in glass houses should not throw stones.

That is why it is important for the ECB to tailor its decisions to primary objectives.

The erstwhile Portuguese Presidency failed to keep its promise and this led to the question being asked that we are dealing with today.

It is our duty to respect their dignity. What good are our grandiose declarations on human rights if we then treat human dignity with such scorn, and in the secrecy of our laboratories, at that?
This concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination.
It impacts on the day-to-day running of the market, also with regard to the candidate countries.


Over and above this we are envisaging a level of around EUR 10 million per year, part of which we expect to be ECHO activities.
We have to make use of it and create the relevant statutory framework.
The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is: Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime?


I am, however, very satisfied that the Commission is in agreement with us that talks with China concerning its membership of the WTO are a matter that Parliament cannot pass over and that we will have this issue heard in this Chamber.


Products should be put on sale, and it should be clear what they contain, but otherwise we must rely upon consumers' own judgement.

This course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society.

We are concerned here with a total of 300 000 refugees out of a population of 10 million people.

I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.
On the 95% of roads, because there are not enough speed checks there either.

With 27-28 or more States, the Union will need stronger institutions, not weaker ones. We will need a stronger, not weaker democratic commitment and a stronger, not more elusive legal system.


The attempt to form a political and defence community came to nothing, but the European Community was created.
If necessary, other working groups on specific issues may be created.

Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves, we then need to use it to good purpose.
This is why it is important that incineration should cost the same across the board and meet the same high environmental requirements.

It was both pertinent and politically intelligent.


For this reason I would like to make this appeal to Members in the other groups: first of all, let us send the joint delegation to Chechnya.
Too little headway has been made liberalising the markets in individual Member States but we assume that the French presidency will make further progress here.

I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.
Secondly, the introduction of the euro itself has fostered further integration of the banking and financial sector.
It is clear that the initiators of the resolution are more concerned with slating the organisation of Euro 2000.
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.
Lastly, I should like once more to make it clear to Parliament that we have not used these doubts or this quarrel about interpretation in relation to Eurodac as an excuse for inaction: the Commission has already submitted a working paper on revising the Dublin Convention, which it has in fact sent to the European Parliament.

I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.

In a shop in my own home town, in Reims, I wish to be able to purchase a bar of chocolate produced according to the gastronomic traditions of my own country, without having to inspect the product on all sides and to put my glasses on in order to check its quality.
In the context of the forthcoming establishment of the European health authority, it would therefore be advisable to allocate this body real resources in order to enable fast detection and thus prevent contagion.


When, Mr President, will the Commission go further on spatial planning and submit new proposals to develop the decision taken at the informal Council meetings, notably at Potsdam and Tampere?

I did not find one single reference in the report which justified Greece' s being singled out, as Mr Karas has done, but I should like to say the following, now that the subject has been raised: it is irresponsible to say that inflation in Greece has only fallen over recent months.


Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.
The growth in demand currently stands at between 5% and 7% and it seems that it will follow the same trend over the next few years. This makes it even more difficult for the European air management systems to do their work, since they have shown themselves to be incapable of dealing with this development and they are the cause of 50% of delays, although it is true that there are other causes, such as the limitations of the airports and flight schedules which do not take account of the limitations of the infrastructures.
Since I am basically critical of EUROPOL, and Schengen in general, and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection, I intend to abstain.
For this reason, the regulation must be amended so that Parliament may maintain its power of influence.
hrm, i'm installing ubuntu on a mates computer, and it keeps freezing on "load hotplug system" or something like that..

The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.
The American President or the head of the British secret service, who is not even known in Britain?

But a balanced agreement - such as the one we should reach on the Green Paper - does not mean that it is a compromise between various extreme positions but rather a coherent report endorsing the future of the whole sector and the viability of fishing as an economic activity throughout the European Union.



Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware.

We recently discussed the precautionary principle and put it to the vote, and we said that we must ban particular substances or procedures if there are justifiable concerns about them, even if there is no definitive proof.
There are regular meetings at all levels.

Commissioner, you say that neither the Treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market stipulate any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector.
Furthermore, our public opinion threatens to become polarised as a result of globalisation.




Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?
Finally, Mr President, I do believe that Europe should resume the provision of semi-structural aid, especially in the areas of education and health care.

The mayors belonging to HADEP were arrested and we rightly criticised this move.

But I also hope that the Commission will now have the courage to act on the demands we have made in this resolution, by refusing to grant research funding to establishments which use these means directly or indirectly.
Because the European Union has, for a number of years, awarded refunds to Member States because it simply was unable spend it all itself.

I will not repeat - although it is true - that Internet time is much shorter than time as we have known it up to now.


However, it is possible to overshoot the mark, even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue.


By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.

So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.
what abt other installations?
Regarding your letter to Mrs Fontaine about the ombudsman, Mr Prodi, do you consider that the ombudsman is bound by any principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions?

The income of people working in farming has fallen by a total of nearly 10% in real terms since 1996.

Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.


Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.


It is only the tip of the iceberg or a Pandora' s box which has been open for a long time.

Now surely a genuine refugee' s priority is to get out of the particular country, not to get into one.
run that command I gave after the colon

Predictably, the main themes, ranging from enlargement to the CIG, via the Charter of Fundamental Rights, were largely put off for the Nice Summit.
You must also consider the following: if we were to entertain such an idea - after all, the price of wood is not just down in the French forestry industry, for the disaster has brought it down throughout the Community - then every other Member State would be within their rights to come and ask us to approve export aid.
That is the question which at some point will need an answer.
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.
I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time, because here too, I repeat, this is breach of contract.
hi ^^

Furthermore, it has given its opinion on specific cases, including the case in question - the execution of Derek Barnabei which was announced in July.


It treats the views of the outside world with contempt.
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.




A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.


I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.
But there are some caveats: we hope that speculation on long-term reform will not be the enemy of necessary radical reform in the immediate period ahead.
This should not be taken as an excuse, but an explanation of why these directives are cited for lack of implementation.




It is also an issue relating to age and to where one is in one' s life.
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.

Mr President, the Commission is doing its utmost to settle proper payment applications within 60 days.
For me also the timber trade is something of great importance, but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important.
I think it is a translation-related problem.
What a wonderful dream this would be, and I am sure that our shared determination will one day make it a reality.


Outcome of the European Council in Lisbon, 23 -24 March 2000
This is why we call upon the Commission and the Council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the Tunisian authorities.


I think this is indeed an opportune moment to have a debate on human rights in Tunisia. It must be held this week because today the trial of Taoufik Ben Brik' s brother is taking place in Tunis and tomorrow a delegation of Members of the European Parliament, from my Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be returning from Tunis.

The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs, with warnings 40% of the packet size on the front and 50% on the back.
That needs the three I' s: information, integration and implementation, which should be the guidelines for the future.
Incorrect interpretation of this article could lead to the use of municipal waste in cement kilns being excluded whereas this type of treatment is provided for by the waste plans of several public authorities.



Furthermore, we stress the fact that, although the association agreements are important and their ratification procedure does need to be speeded up, they cannot be used as the basis for a policy which must, by nature, be multilateral.
The Geneva Conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action.


Allow me to make just one remark, which relates to the risk of exclusion that could emerge if we do not pay special attention to the needs of disadvantaged people.


I will now begin my own, Madam President.
There is one last point which I wish to put forward, namely the need for a system for labelling and providing information on all forms of electricity.

I do not share this view either, and nor did the majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, because Mr Le Pen is still within the time limit for lodging an appeal.
Elite sport, be it amateur or professional, receives global media coverage today.


most people here are desktop-only users, it seems..
However, it also clearly shows that there are far too many barriers, and the Commission has our full support in tackling them.
We cannot, however enter into the kind of dialogue that the proponents of violence are calling for, as that kind of dialogue is not permissible in a democratic and open society.



I apologise for the fact that I cannot stay to the end of this debate owing to exigencies of transport between here and Edinburgh, but I am delighted to have had the chance of participating so far.
Where Parliament' s 1998 accounts are concerned, I would note that the problem is the same as in other areas of the Union, namely an all too careless attitude to the way in which the money is used.
If the concept of ethnic groups and minorities is re-established, this will take us down a dangerous road towards individual membership rather than political and national membership.
The intensive discussion in recent weeks of our visions of Europe' s future has been stimulating, but it causes disquiet in the candidate States.
This is a very urgent matter.
dunno

Our group also notes the request for the OHR and the Commission to provide information detailing the reasons leading to this confusion of interests.
I thought that was the case.
So it will certainly not be possible to put the new proposal into practice.

When will you make it compulsory?
In July, a debate will be held in the Security Council.


We believe that we must ensure that the work requested by Parliament of the Ethics Committee - which advises the Commission and Parliament - is speeded up and we believe, furthermore, that an issue as important as this, which involves various committees of this Parliament and which is generating enormous concern in many areas - frozen embryos, the patentability of cells which may be multiplied for the purposes of transplants etc. requires a temporary committee.



On this subject, it must be said that the instruments of the first pillar frequently provide for sanctions, but these do not necessarily need to be in the form of criminal law.


The Commission is insisting on the need for reinforced coordination with the government around the shared comprehensive reconstruction framework.


I congratulate her most comprehensively for the way she did it.

Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.
Mr President, I should like to express our support for Mr Varela' s report and, at the same time, thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries for being so cooperative in the Committee.
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.

We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.
Mr Lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments.
And finally, I appeal to the Commission, which I hope will submit its proposed action programme for responding to the urgent nature of this phenomenon in the very near future.

There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier.

And now, to express my own personal opinion, I would like to say more generally that I support the conclusions of Mrs Stauner' s report with a view to postponing discharge to the Commission for the year 1998.
Now, you know we can combine this criterion with other aspects, especially unemployment, but I would like us to retain this criterion as I think it an objective one.
This is the only way to achieve the consensus such a policy requires.
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.
We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House.

2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	mike998	do you have access to a partitioning tool ?
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.
To give another example, it cannot be put down to merit that there are 22 A1 or A2 Spaniards and 16 Belgian ones.
We see evidence of this in the Sudan, and Sierra Leone, and the phenomenon is also on the increase in a number of other countries.
I would also like to stress the need to speed up the establishment of legal instruments which will facilitate the mobilisation of funds that have already been earmarked for this purpose.
Sometimes there is talk, in general terms, of the full range of SME support, and sometimes the individual components of the ASAP are cited in different contexts.
These factors are, first, that the CAP, especially in its post-1992 form and following Agenda 2000, does not safeguard a viable income for most small or medium-sized farming households, or a survival income for the heads of these households, which is why no one wants to invest anything at all in the farming sector, however many grants there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it unprofitable, it does not even afford a basic income.

We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops.
The Commission too has based its conclusions on the priorities for the budget 2001 on an estimated financing requirement in the order of EUR 5.5 billion for the period up to 2006.

We should provide consumers with information about the origin of the beef, offer them certainty and take consumer protection seriously.
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.

One further request, both to Parliament' s President and to the Council and the Commission: the texts are still deficient in so far as the specialist terminology in the specific languages is not correct.

squeak?

This means that their specific importance in many cases, given the significant quantities they have to distribute, is greater than that of the ambassadors and of the Member States.


This makes sense and needs to be regulated, and we need to support young people and small clubs so that they can promote themselves.
It has been pointed out on several sides that demands are being made on the Commission.

All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.

The summit between the European Union and the African countries was held just a few days ago.

Mr President, in conclusion, the most important thing is that we obtain a system which means that by looking at a label on the meat we can see where it comes from, and that it is then possible to trace back through the complete foodstuffs chain to the original producer.
Mr President, since there will no doubt be another quorum vote, I would like to remind the President and the Members of this Parliament that, during a quorum vote, it is not permitted to leave the chamber.

It is equally urgent, however, that the Commission should hasten the review of Directive 94/45/EC on the setting up of a European Works Council and Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89, so as to ensure greater participation by workers' organisations prior to decisions on the concentration and transfer of undertakings and a greater guarantee of protection and defence of workers' rights.
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.

It is therefore just as important to tackle the plundering of architectural finds as it is to combat the thoughtless destruction of the remnants of social institutions.

In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.

I am therefore looking forward to reporting on the progress made during the next couple of months.
This means that we have not yet managed to use the resources of the new economy to resolve the problems of the old economy. We will never find solutions to those problems if we approach them with the mindset of that old economy.

What we need to do is to harmonise criteria, have a single list of prohibited substances, homogenise tests, have warnings on drugs and do more research.
I am not aware of any vengeful articles by investigative journalists, or any OLAF inquiries, and personally I have not managed to discover any proven cases of mismanagement, fraud or misappropriation of funds in our sector.



First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.

It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.

In conclusion, I support the proposals to strengthen the role of Eurocontrol, the pan-European agency responsible for the management of the airspace of European states, be they members of the European Union or not, in its capacity as regulatory authority.

In Europe, however, as many people have said, the position of research looks worrying if one looks at the figures.

The EU' s support - on which we are probably all agreed - can roughly take two forms. It would be beneficial to support the media in the neighbouring countries: Croatia and a number of other countries have been mentioned.

The programme has been running for twelve years and the Commission has waited right until it is about to end before considering whether to carry on with it.

The way to resolve conservation questions is not by moving to different fish stocks and bringing them into a quota system, but by ensuring that we have certain no-go areas where we can allow fishing stocks to re-mature.

Either way, it remains our hope that legislative developments on the other side of the Atlantic will render the safe harbour obsolete and we salute the Commission in the work they have done in achieving what they clearly believe is the best achievable result.
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure? I would like to hear your opinion.

I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews.


We all recognise that the European Union, in spite of economic recovery, is still working well below par for too many people; specifically for 15 million of our fellow citizens the EU is simply not working at all.

I would like to appeal to the Swedish Presidency.
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.
First of all, why is it that there is still no real dialogue at official level between the Chinese Government and the Tibetan Government in exile?
The Commission proposes to reduce excessive scrutiny arrangements for individual projects in the Management Committee by introducing strategic programmes through the yearly adoption of national financing plans and a regional financing plan and simplifying decision making.
For that reason, our Group does not support the amendments, because we hope that, by withholding our support, we can expedite the process of adopting this directive.
Mr President, the programme of the Swedish Presidency is a fine piece of work, but there is still no indication as to how it is to be executed at a practical level.

(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.

More specific action could be also be undertaken with regard to developing awareness-raising campaigns on the real possibilities of legal immigration and on all forms of trafficking, as well as increasing the ability of the authorities in the countries of origin or transit to effectively combat this type of crime themselves.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.
We should like, on the whole, to see a more balanced investment policy, aimed at increasing diversification and investment in the environment and, at the same time, reducing investment in the roads sector.
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.



We must endeavour to keep Community legislation as straightforward as possible and avoid any inconsistencies in the overall framework.

In addition to those comments, and in answer to Mr Napolitano' s questions, I would like to say this. Ladies and gentlemen, you need have no doubt that the Commission definitely intends to keep on working towards what must be our ambition for this Conference: success in Nice, not just reaching a conclusion in Nice, because succeeding and concluding are two different things.




We should point to progress made so far in liberalising the electricity and the gas markets, in particular opening up electricity to more than 60% of the market so far, while also remembering that we need to keep up the pressure for more progress.

In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?

At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.
We think, at first glance, that the present liability law achieves a fair balance between the interests of consumers on the one hand and the interests of product manufacturers on the other.
Mr President, I certainly agree with Mr Bowe's final summary.

Democracy: the Intergovernmental Conference does not appear to resolve the issue of the alleged democratic deficit, and so-called closer cooperation on its own will not suffice.
In any event, if there is anyone here in this House - and I do not think that there is - who believes that Europe has no future, they can express it somewhat differently.
Mr Lannoye, I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned.



We had an opportunity to listen to and hold discussions with workers' representatives and with union leaders from Portugal and other parts of Europe. In particular, we met representatives from ABB, from Michelin and also the organisers of job marches.

The present report contains an amendment which states that the full range of cost recovery systems should not be admitted within the European Union because some cost recovery systems for port reception facilities do not do justice to what is needed to keep our environment clean.
The first speaker in the main meeting was Mr Hughes.

In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.


The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.
To some extent, of course, the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international.
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.

We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.


Dozens of proposals were submitted there, also in this area of policy.
This is absurd and is something of a disaster.
So whenever someone shouts into the microphone - even though they should not - I would ask that the sound volume in the Chamber be lowered immediately, so that we can also hear what is being said over the headphones.
Of course, if you can act more rapidly, you make a contribution to crisis prevention.

That is what we want, that is what we need and that is what we shall vote for.

Secondly: I am also delighted that we are again stepping up the political debate on the party statute, the pressure of time in the run up to the final stage of the intergovernmental conference notwithstanding.
Subject: Developing countries and farm animal welfare What steps is the Commission taking, both through the Community' s development programme and its influence on the world stage, to encourage developing countries not to adopt industrial animal husbandry systems, as these pose serious threats to poverty alleviation, the environment, human health and animal welfare in developing countries?
The requirements that Israel must evacuate the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees must have the right of return, Israel must have the right to live in peace within secure and recognised borders and Palestinians must have the right to their own sovereign, viable and undivided state, whose international borders are open and which is not under military control, are inextricably linked and all these rights must be fulfilled at the same time.

But there is a desire from consumers that we should address the question of the natural production of food.
As Mrs Jackson has said, Greece is already paying EUR 20 000 a day and I trust that Greece will come to its senses and fall into line.

Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.
The first EC-Bangladesh Joint Committee meeting under the new cooperation agreement is now planned for the first half of March 2001, so the train is on the move.

Point two is that industry has been making distinct noises to the effect that the existing discrepancies are forming an obstacle, and so are costs incurred in processing. These aspects very much form part of the European agricultural policy.
We welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets.





I am voting against this new step in the wrong direction.
Aid to Mediterranean countries must be provided quickly and efficiently, in line with the European Union' s political priorities.


As Mr Naïr rightly said, the European Union only appears to be interested in the Mediterranean for reasons of security and only intervenes economically in order to gain a foothold on the markets in the southern countries.
That is not the place to find a solution for these areas, as the Commissioner and the whole of the Commission seems to think.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European transport situation can be summed up using several pertinent figures.


It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.
In an increasingly overt way, the international partners delight in describing countries involved in harsh repression and widespread corruption, where increasing social instability prevails, as stable and successful.

Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.



Trains are still chugging round Europe, but there is less and less freight in their wagons and that is a state of affairs which we cannot tolerate.
It is therefore right to pursue, with a coordinated approach, all the scientific investigations necessary to clarify the impact of this type of arm on health and the environment, but, in the meantime, it is also right to apply the precautionary principle, which has never been so appropriate as on this occasion, and that is why it is urgent and vital to impose a moratorium.
For that reason, I support Amendment No 1 by Mrs Schierhuber on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
The EUR 15 million loan now to be made must be coordinated with assistance from the IMF and other international agencies with the aim of boosting Moldova' s social and economic stability.
The wealth and diversity of diplomatic experience in the various countries of Europe is also recognised throughout the world.


In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.
There are a number of conflicts within Indonesia.
On a more general note, a sensible approach to transport would require a sensible approach to manufacturing, an approach, in other words, that does not place profit above all else.

But in one interview he spoke the truth when he said that the Kursk accident was symptomatic of Russia's condition as a whole.
The European Parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision.


Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register.


A great deal of work has been done locally, both in Scotland and around the North Sea, on conservation measures in general and on cod recovery in particular.
So what we need to do is to remove both cows' and pigs' brains from the whole sausage, from the whole food chain.

In that way interest payments are saved and, at the same time, we have a little room for manoeuvre in the budget for the years to come.
what makes ubuntu better than KDE?
You tell us that there have had to be negotiations and that there is already aid from the COM in fruit and also within the framework of the rural development projects.
Our partners are expecting practical steps to be taken, as Mr Naïr stressed in his report, which I thought was particularly valuable.
In future, the Commission' s reports should contain feedback on the users of the fund so that defects in the system can be speedily rectified.

It is first pillar - for those who understand Union jargon - and is driven by the Commission.
In December of last year, the Council was united in reaching a number of conclusions concerning how asylum seekers should be received.
I refer, for example, to the insufficient democratic transparency displayed leading up to the agreement, and we, along with all the other Members I imagine, have received a great deal of criticism on this point from both Mexican and European civil organisations, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler said.
Despite this, people are killed every day on the road networks of the EU because of this precise combination.

The Commissioner knows, as I do, that the current situation in the NAFO is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the Estai.

If there is the slightest suspicion that an individual substance may have harmful effects, as is the case with oestradiol 17â, then we must react with a definitive ban.

There is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general.

Firstly, what conditions must Denmark fulfil before the ECB will intervene in support of the krone?


There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.

on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.
It could, in itself, contribute towards the common policy based on best practices.
There are no borders when it comes to subjects such as our present concern of drug addiction and the trafficking of narcotics, and so it is certainly a useful, sustainable initiative to set objectives which include countries which are not currently Members of the European Union but which are in the pre-accession phase, countries taking part in the PHARE programme or Norway, in their prevention or suppression strategies, for this will help us to broaden the scope of our anti-drugs strategy.
However, they can also help the EU' s technological development and enable us to export clean technologies to other parts of the world.
We are beginning to build and implement the instruments for the 'communitisation' of the area of freedom, security and justice and, as we will never tire of saying in this House, this cannot be done without the national parliaments and without the European Parliament, because these issues are far too important to the citizens not to be endorsed through a strong social consensus.
The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement.
Firstly, because the objective of the fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries are, as is explicitly stated in some other reports, intended to spare European Union fisheries resources and, consequently, to increase catches from the waters of other countries.



Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must, however, be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work.
As regards coming back to the Parliament, I would say that I am always of course willing to go to the Development Committee and discuss any issue.


i dont know what the heck i am doing... i am totally lost..

The Commission is not able to accept those amendments of Parliament which would widen the scope of the proposed ban to cover plasticisers other than the six named phthalates, or to cover other toys than those intended to be put in the mouth.
Therefore, the rules on this are strict.
Could you launch an investigation into this matter to establish that Mr Hannan did not use Parliament premises or the staff to which he is entitled as a Member of this House to raise that money?
Mr President, whilst recently at my sister-in-law's house, I noticed that she had a container of "eco-friendly" washing-up liquid.
Investments in these areas are primarily supported by loans from the European Investment Bank as well as other donors.
In this regard, the Group of the European People' s Party has tabled amendments aimed precisely at achieving greater coherence between the positions.


This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.

We must develop complementary, and not duplicate, structures.
It is a question of the right opportunity and time for this political change to occur.
It must be acknowledged that, in the course of time, technological need has always been the predominant criterion.

Snegec, an assertion is something that shouldn't happen :)




We in the Commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success.
I am glad to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in substantial agreement with Mr Langen and finds no legal obstacles to this bloc exemption regulation.
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.

Can I first of all welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work in bringing forward this report?

It is true that proposals on voting rights for foreigners do not fit in at all in a report on xenophobia, but we do agree on the principle of drafting a recommendation in this respect.



The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.
Mr President, Commissioner, in relation to what Mrs Haug had to present, a banker might say that the budget for the other institutions is peanuts; small budgets which are not as significant, including from the political standpoint, but which are important nonetheless because they allow the other institutions to make their work transparent and thus, I think, to look their citizens in the eye.

I am an advocate of the system.
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.


No, I am certainly not expecting tangible, huge successes, but what matters is what happened at a deeper level.
The success of the IGC now will actually be the best basis on which to build the huge project for the greater Europe of tomorrow.




It is not enough for Caesar's wife to be respectable, she must also appear to be respectable.
As paragraphs 20 and 21 say, the additionality principle has not been operating with an effective, transparent style up to now.



I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.


At the same time, the so-called Convention which is drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union is stubbornly refusing to take this principle into consideration.

The social aspects of Europe' s development are the other side of the same coin, and that is where we will focus our efforts during these next six months.
The European Commission has been aware of this for three years.

The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.
We welcome the debate on the age limit.


In Europe we have come so far - I only need to mention the implementation of Schengen, meaning that there are no longer any controls at the vast majority of borders - that nothing else is simply good enough anymore.
The question we now face now with regard to the circumstances I have just described is to know what real objectives and priorities this new agreement hopes to achieve and in general, what effects we hope to have on sustainable development in the field of administration and on the participation of the public and public organisations in national life.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their support of the Commission' s proposal and draft report.
If they do not come up with satisfactory solutions, I shall campaign for our obtaining a parliamentary committee of inquiry which can examine the matter in depth.
Can you please do something about it?
Subject: Institutional reform In the Action Plan on Reform it is stated that an 'external legal expert' should sit in an advisory capacity on Disciplinary boards.

For me there is an awful sense of déja vu - or perhaps I should say déja entendu - about this debate today.
I feel that I must congratulate the Socialist government on having convinced the French President so thoroughly.

mako: 
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.
Or will we soon find ourselves in the kind of world depicted in that excellent film 'Gattaca' ?
Madam President, with your permission I should like to use this brief opportunity at the end of this debate to respond to something which was raised in a point of order at the start of this sitting. I consider this to be the Council' s legitimate right.

This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.


Tyche, yes, that's what i do
I think that we must, of course, vote en masse in favour of this resolution, but that we must also vote for the amendment tabled by Mr Thomas Mann, by the liberal group and by the Group of the Greens, an amendment which asks our governments to consider the possibility of recognising the exiled Tibetan Government if, within three years, the Chinese authorities and the exiled Tibetan Government have not ultimately signed an agreement on the substantial autonomy of Tibet.
if this dont worjk
Speight should not be let off the hook.

The signal we send out must be clear.
However, the Commission cannot accept the inclusion of provisions on import and export obligations in the text of the directive.
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.
I have been in this House since 1984, and rarely have I seen such neglect - such wilful neglect - by the European Union in dealing with a famine of this kind that we knew was on our doorstep.



This disorients people and makes them prey to the unaccountable dictates of big business.

On the first question, the Commission is aware of the concerns that have been raised in France and elsewhere about the directive and in particular about possible inconsistencies between two paragraphs of Article 5 of the directive.
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this.

There is too much at stake for us to fail to call for the mobilisation of the general population against this danger, and that is why I am compelled to vote in favour of this report.

This is the first time that this Parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the Member States.

At the time, 120 countries voted in favour and 7 against.

Mr President, in the absence of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and on his request, I will speak on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture.

Has the Commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the COM in bananas?


It is perhaps difficult to know who is going to provide the salutary shock, and when.


Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, needless to say, all forms of violence should be denounced, including the outrageous expressions of hooliganism during Euro 2000.
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.
Finally, I would like to say that not one lobbyist from the chemical industry has come up to me. My concern relates solely to the vague application of the precautionary principle.

Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.

These are inflammable gases - butane, isobutane and propane.

We need to guarantee that, in theory, you will face the same procedure everywhere, irrespective of whether you make your application in Spain, Germany or England.
:)
At the present stage, the opinions of the various operators involved are still, I would say, rather contradictory and have not, in any case, been firmly expressed.


For a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains. According to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains.
Evidently, we need an immediate political response from the 15 Member States of the European Union.
Mr President, let me say to Mr McMillan-Scott that a spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of economic efficiency and one wonders why it is still so evasive despite all the great efforts that liberalism has put into it.

The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.
I can assure you that I will do my utmost to be able to present a proposal for legislation on liability before the end of 2001.


However, this is something we do accept when it comes to roads but which, of course, we do not where aviation is concerned.
We need clarification on which of the three facilities - start-up capital, guarantees, or joint ventures - have achieved the best results, in which States and which sectors companies were set up, whether the small enterprises had access to foreign capital too, or whether statements originating from SME circles are correct, according to which, more than 50 000 new jobs were created simply by means of interest subsidies to the value of EUR 100 million, which age groups are especially required, and to what extent women were involved.

I think we also need the situation to be addressed with the assistance and under the supervision of the European Union. I talk of supervision because Turkey is, of course, a candidate country and its candidature must meet the Copenhagen criteria, which are damaged by such incidents, incidents which, of course, are recorded by us and, I assume, by the Commission, which is called on in our resolution to specifically mention the situation in Turkish prisons in its annual report.




The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea.

My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.
From this point of view, I think that the references in the compromise motion for a resolution, which deserves our total support, are most timely.

If we are to prevent this scourge, we must first familiarise ourselves with it.
it worked
A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since.
In order to respect and fully guarantee Community legislative power, we must urgently adopt legislation on rights to freedom of movement, immigration and asylum.
I should first of all like to know whether the Swedish Government has informed its colleagues in the Council as to whether it is planned to use the veto in the event of an EU action, that is to say an EU military action, being taken in the absence of a decision in the UN' s Security Council.
I look forward to my new Labour colleagues voting on this particular matter.

But let me point out that, in relation to the Mediterranean region, the Commission proposal provides that in this coming period - i.e. up to 2006 - the resources available for the MEDA programme will be increased overall by 13% compared with the previous period.
I did of course send a message to this effect to the Indian authorities immediately.
The region has the lowest per capita availability of water anywhere in the world and it is steadily decreasing.

Parliament is here, it has its views, it supports them clearly and will, we believe, support them during tomorrow's vote which, I think, will confirm what was decided at the committee meeting during which the reports were adopted by a large majority.

It is highly significant that, in your capacities as the speakers of the two assemblies which will be required to ratify the agreements which are being drawn up, and in which negotiations you are yourselves taking part, you have opted to come together to address the European Parliament.
We know that in many developing countries, the economy is carried by women, and we support this.

It is very painful for the farming industry to see this happen and it is happening now throughout the whole of Europe, so action needs to be taken.
In fact it means that a strict relationship should be preserved between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.
Mr President, I should like to express my thanks for the broad support given to the main features of this report.



Madam President, President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, you said just now that your comments in the interview were made in a German context, but it is far from being an internal German issue.

They range from reductions in customs tariffs, from starting rates of often over 40% to an average of 10%, to the opening of import and export monopolies via joint ventures in the service sector, trade chains and medium-term freedom of establishment for independent European undertakings.


More importantly, what is to be done about the gaping wound in the Social Fund in Greece which, in my view, is no more than a black hole which just swallows up Community funds?
Moreover, it is important to stimulate cooperation between schools and various bodies, also at local and regional level.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Most national railway systems in the Member States have comprehensive rules governing the aforementioned social aspects and rather than lose them in the process of liberalisation at European level, we must harmonise them at the highest possible level.
They have led to well thought-through and promising initiatives and projects at national level, but these absorb a huge amount of funding.

I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.
It is unbelievable that there is a situation where the Palestinian Legislative Council cannot even meet.

Today, in order to give more meaning to all the current thinking on consumer safety and in order to reconcile Europe with civil society, particularly that society which successfully made its views felt in Seattle and elsewhere, expressing its anxieties about food quality and food safety, could the Commission not take the initiative of organising a forum for a large-scale debate between, on the one hand, the responsible parties from the Commission, the representatives of governments and members of parliament, of course, but also the representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations, consumers' organisations, and professionals involved in the sector, in such a way as to ensure that these debates filter down to the European citizen?

These are the European Commission' s twin objectives.
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.
As planned, the Commission will submit a report on the functioning of the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables before the end of this year.

This House should certainly not get into the habit of letting subjects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the week go by the board.


There is no certainty either that Russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases.

It is capable of producing hunger and misery on a massive scale.
This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States.
Mr President, despite the resources that the Structural Funds have been devoting for years to furthering territorial balance in the European Union, the 25 richest regions still have a per capita income two and a half times higher than the poorest, and despite the many needs put forward by these least-favoured regions, not all the appropriations earmarked as development funds are actually used each year.
It is true that, when it comes to the ways in which waste is dealt with and is co-incinerated using large quantities of biomass fuels, there are really quite enormous differences between northern Scandinavia (where the transport routes are also long) and the densely populated areas of Central Europe where the problem is, quite literally, more one of waste incineration and of refuse collection and disposal than of, for example, generating combined power and heat.
The Commission believes that the FIFA rules on transfers unfairly obstruct freedom of movement.

Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.

As far as medication is concerned, it would be much better to maintain our high veterinary standards, thereby guaranteeing that only safe beef reaches the market.
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.
The UNCTAD report on sub-Saharan Africa shows that African countries have not received any benefit from structural adjustment programmes for over ten years.
When we purchase hardware, it is always an investment, but when we acquire software labelled 'company staff training' , it is not considered to be an investment.
But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament, by consensus or not, as the case may be.
However, the Committee on Budgets is raising two objections.

Aoi: these routers cost something like usd30, 40. really worth their money.
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.

If he were there as a private individual, he should have let this be known in the Danish campaign.

But unlike Talleyrand, I cannot console myself with the idea that what is exaggerated is by the same token insignificant.

I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia.

Certain people in the Council are of the opinion that ECHO' s activities should be reduced, but I take the completely opposite view.

No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.
It is now quite certain, however, that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times.
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.

ogra, do you have it working in hoary?
One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning.
There is every reason for the working parties which have now been appointed to quickly and effectively make contact, within the framework of the Union's work, with other international organisations working with these issues.


Everything is open here in Parliament.
Having said this, may I suggest, Minister, that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ÍÁÔÏ.

My country is a sad example of this.




In this Parliament we have to make every effort now, as the rapporteur has said, to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people of South Africa.
There are significant undertakings concerning, firstly, the organisation and coordination of statistical services in Greece with those in other European countries and of Eurostat. It is clear that, without a statistical base, it is difficult for us to put in place specific policies.
Finally, the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected.


Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.
We can make use of this position to fight actively for human rights.

This is what we asked the Commission for.

Since then, this support has been implemented in practical terms by the setting up of a new budget line, with the funds made available intended for campaigns to raise awareness, within the European Union, and to combat the development of child sex tourism.
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law. This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.

Finally, regarding budgetary provisions within the Member States between the central government and the regions, the Commission can only repeat that these are matters exclusively for national consideration and are not related to additionality as defined in the regulations.

We are careful to avoid this further problem.
Haha

The danger, it seemed to us, was that the European Union would have been left with absolutely nothing.
I was very surprised by the letter which you have just read from the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee.
The implementation of the Habitats Directive is intended to provide long-term protection for a European network of biologically outstanding natural habitats and to exempt them from future redevelopment in order to prevent conflicts in land use or damage to those environments.
neep neep
Above all, there is the respect with which the Portuguese Presidency always treated this Parliament, which will certainly have contributed to future presidencies adopting a new stance in their relations with Parliament.
It is not enough to achieve good results in agriculture or anything else.

We want to encourage and, indeed, in some circumstances, require nation states to look at their present laws, to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts.


Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.

In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.
I am pleased to learn of the intentions which he announced on behalf of the Commission, which are generally in line with those of the French Presidency.

It is wise to remain vigilant when it comes to observing human rights of the extensive minorities in Europe.
I want to thank the President and the Commissioner for their understanding.


With that in mind, the Commission - I say this in view of the occasion - has taken upon itself the task of monitoring the activities of one Member State in particular very closely.

Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.
The aim of this report is to give our fellow Members, who are members of the Convention, a clear and specific mandate detailing the expectations of the European Parliament and to give our fellow citizens clear evidence of our commitment to ensuring that their fundamental rights are properly respected by the institutions of the Union.
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.
There is a presidential campaign under way.


I've been able to avoid going into the terminal for a lot of stuff, which is nice.


As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.




I might point out that it will only be possible to make this kind of headway in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Parliament.



I do not consider there to be any link, whether direct or indirect, between Portugal' s defeat and the outbreaks of hooliganism.


The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.

This may apply to students who have to prove that they have a proper place at university or to pensioners who have to prove that they will be taking their pensions or own capital with them if they move.
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.

Behind us sit students, interns and people from the Permanent Representations with the confidential drafts marked 'restrained' , while we MEPs cannot obtain them.


In normal administrative relations, this decision by Parliament would be final; not so in the European Union.


May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.

You need to realise that we need to be able to repatriate people of their own free will, but I do not believe in this free will.
Inequalities and relationships of dependency between privileged and disadvantaged countries mean that it is still always the weakest in society, particularly the women, who pay the price.
These poverty alleviation programmes facilitate the pursuance of dialogue with civil society and provide an appropriate political signal.
However, these guidelines are not just about enlargement they are about policy direction for all the institutions next year.
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.

Irrespective of the decision taken on 1 May, this issue would have to be referred back to national governments for further discussion.
Clear, well-defined rules governing the matter are also necessary in order to avoid the right to asylum being confused with the problem of immigration.



Of course, I acknowledge that there is still much to be done.

These indicators can then be used as the basis for the synthesis report to the European Council in spring next year.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
In spite of the fact that there have been several attempts to solve the problems, partly within the International Railway Union, this is especially the case in the area we are discussing here this evening, namely that of Europe' s railway networks.
A great deal of work needs to be done.

We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved, thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities.
It is justifiable that the report adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport should contain a request to the Commission to apply the notion of further education, not only at the level of advanced know-how and skills and universities, but also in traditional professions, particularly the craftsmen trades.
- (DA) We have voted today in favour of Mr Bösch' s report on the more effective combating of fraud and irregularities involving EU resources.
We therefore believe that hemp production ought not to be promoted through increased aid, and we are abstaining from voting on Mrs Schierhuber' s report.

The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.
In fact, it is being amended again today for the fifth time.
pozac: ok :)



It was not by chance that the party with the second largest vote in the Austrian elections was not invited to form the government.






Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your extremely kind words.
Mr President, let us send out a very clear and unequivocal message from this Parliament today that violence has no role of any description in solving the problems of a divided people.
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.

Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000, the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it.


The rapporteur quite rightly reminds us here that the fluctuations in the euro's predecessor currencies were far greater than those recorded so far for the euro, so there has been no deterioration there.



President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.


(FR) I have a special interest in the matter of toy safety.

What will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen, above all, in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the Structural Fund?
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.

In an unstable agricultural industry, the opportunities offered by flax and hemp in a developing market for natural fibres should not be lost.


Secondly, we need to develop policies which will reduce the disparities between the richest countries and the poorest countries.



The Committee therefore calls upon the Commission and the individual Member States, each according to its powers but above all with firm determination, to take up Parliament' s proposals and to become active in this matter.


It is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis.
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea. It is also of great importance to citizens.
martin_: reinistall this package before you upgrade to the next stable version of ubuntu....many things will rely on it
We cannot afford to waste time.
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.

Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.




This is very clearly borne out by the McCartin report.


Unfortunately, Russia is only accepting this in words, not in deeds.

The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.
Opening up to the world market, on the other hand, will expose it to the law of the jungle and to the plundering of the natural resources of Africa, wood, oil, minerals, the flora and even the fauna, by multinationals.
President Chirac yesterday emphasised with eloquence the importance of finding the right balance between these two objectives, and I wish you would listen to your President.



The intention to achieve actual coordination of the socio-economic policy across the board appeals to me a great deal.
Secondly, the need to develop decentralised cooperation that aims to enable contracts with local authorities and civil society, particularly NGOs, for both cross-border regions and in the South-South context, as well as for regional integration. Thirdly, we should like to highlight the decision of Parliament and the Commission to carry out an annual assessment of the human rights situation in signatory countries.

For example there is a regulation on the table which regulates access to documents from the Council, the Commission and Parliament.

I cannot support the proposal that military resources should be used to defend the European Union' s interests.

All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.


It will have to initiate these negotiations.

Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.


This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.

It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.
However, Mr Bonde, you should not, of course, confuse economic and monetary union with Nazism, they are in fact slightly different.
The Commission' s initial proposal was much more ambitious, but since we are moving in that pioneer territory of the internal market - that territory which involves elements which are still the competence of the Member States such as procedural rules and civil law, ownership reservations, or Article 5 of the procedure for the recovery of non-contested debt etc...- the Commission' s proposal was not in accordance with the Treaty, since we lacked a legal basis.



Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.
It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union, and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future.
This was reiterated in the presidency' s report that was approved by the Helsinki European Council.

I do not wish to trawl through the figures recording the consequences of the hurricane again. I would simply stress the fact that the social and environmental damage concerns us far more than the economic damage caused, and it is that which is affecting this region.

On several occasions, including in recent months, we have drawn up resolutions on human rights in Columbia, resolutions adopted in this Chamber.
For this reason, it is becoming a matter of urgency to reopen talks within the WTO and to rethink the Blair House agreements.


(The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. for the vote and resumed at 11 a.m.)

Perhaps the amendments we adopted in the Environment Committee go too far.



However, perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe.


or is everything pretty broken?

Respect for the rights of the child must be anchored in the European Treaties if we are to guarantee protection for children in principle.
The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees.
We have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important.

DoktorTomoe: so did i. but i turned to be version 0.9.6



I have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now.
In addition, trade unions in other areas fear that unregulated structures will spread and social standards will drop.



I should like to thank the Commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this House as well as from the Council, which were along the same lines.

With regard to content, Parliament has agreed to commit EUR 135 million over the next five years to measures aiming to compensate Turkey for the sacrifices it has agreed to make in order to enter into a customs union with the European Union, and on this point there is no divergence with the Council.
I should also like to comment briefly on independent agencies.
The UN has a peace plan.
Mr President, it may be that President Fontaine was unfamiliar with the British rules of protocol which obtain in such matters, but Mr Miller has no such excuse.
Madam President, for reasons of a topical nature, I am in a position to give this issue my wholehearted support.
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.

The group chairmen unanimously requested the Commission to grant the Members of Parliament the legal right of access to the documents which are issued in other connections.
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cache.S: Assembler messages:



It ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers, distributors and consumers.


It demands a great deal in terms of the supply of information and, especially, in terms of the coordination which is needed if cooperation is to succeed, both within the Member States and independently of the Member States.



lostmonk, look here



River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.
Finally, President, let us be sure that we work as a European Union to create the conditions which will allow the people of Zimbabwe to express their choices in this election in June and express their choices in secret and without fear.




Madam President, at the end of this extremely interesting debate perhaps I can explain the division of labour or work-sharing on the Commission's side.
In my judgement it is simply not an option.
From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety.

What we do need is for the assessments in question to be made available.
The first is a profound questioning of all the institutional players in Europe; the second factor is the distance and the lack of understanding that separate the general public from the European institutions, and the third factor, which is the key to the first two, is a loss of perspective.


Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.
The political leaders and the civil society of the partner States must have their decision-making powers strengthened, as must the EU delegation posts in situ, which is already happening with the elaboration of national indicative programmes within the scope of ACP cooperation.
These measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of February 1997.

Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.
However, by adopting this flexible approach, Mr Ferri saw fit to withdraw his proposals and I thank him for that.
Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, which is part of the Group of the European People' s Party, and I, myself, as its representative, voted for the Hatzidakis report on the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European networks, mainly because communications within our Union are the single most important factor in the creation of Europe and the most important issue where the principle of subsidiarity is applied in practice.


The enactment of the general act on equal treatment cost the Netherlands blood, sweat and tears at the time.
Madam President, given that the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee is present, I should like to respond immediately to my fellow Member by saying that we are indeed going to hold a meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee this week, and I shall immediately contact the Ambassador, who is scheduled to visit us on Thursday, to see if he can offer some response to these questions as early as the Thursday sitting, and I am perfectly willing to invite my fellow Member to take part in our proceedings on Thursday morning.

This is a common concern of all the Member States, whether large or small, not only due to the need, in ratifying the new Treaty, to enable enlargement and respect for its timetables, but also due to the feeling that a European crisis should not be allowed to occur on this type of reform. There is also the idea that these reforms must be submitted to public opinion in the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe so that the impression is not given that these are reforms which must be rushed through, not to improve the European Union but to prevent the new Member States from having access to the EU' s decision-making system.
As long as the Member States are of the basic opinion that social issues should be dealt with by the Member States themselves, there will be no rapid change.


Those cases which are mentioned may be dealt with as special categories, as special cases or, at worst, as exceptions.
As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil.




But even that was evidently not enough for the rebel leader Sankoh.
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.


I would like to begin by echoing previous speakers and adding my words of thanks to the rapporteur and to our chairman and to you for the magnificent work you did in that conciliation.

The Commission replies here with a system that we call the Olendorf method, a method of language-learning that consists of the teacher asking the student "Have you got my uncle's underpants?" and the student replying "No, but I have my grandmother's glasses" .
The motion, therefore, is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option.

We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.

That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.
I am extremely pleased to see the President of the Commission here and I hope that Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, will assert his presidential leadership on a regular basis in that way on strategic issues such as enlargement.



Thirdly, we have not abolished the derogation for individual Member States.

The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.
As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.
How much did the destruction cost?


I have also heard that, this morning, a Commissioner attended the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.


It concerns the issue of recycling costs.

The Commission intends to continue supporting intermodal transport, through research in the framework programmes for technological research and development and also by extending and enlarging the pilot actions for combined transport (the PACTs).
One of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing, olive oil and human rights in China!

The House is sovereign in these matters.

Mr President, the directive on the incineration of waste is well intended but I think those responsible for preparing it have gone into too much detail.
dunno

Article 16 of Directive 78/319/EEC states: 'Every three years, and for the first time three years following the notification of this Directive, Member States shall draw up a situation report on the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste in their respective countries and shall forward it to the Commission'.
I should like briefly to go into the individual proposals in the Bösch report which now come within a wider context; this applies, for example, to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the European Court of Auditors.
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.
It offers more power, more choice, lower prices to citizens across Europe and indeed across the world, and in my view the best thing that governments can do in cyberspace is to stay out of it as much as they possibly can and let consumers, businesses and citizens get on with their businesses and their lives.

This is the case for Algeria.

Thus, in some way, taking a snapshot of the per capita standard of living, we have produced an accurate snapshot of the real state of the regions - and indeed it is no mere accident that my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and all the other Members of Parliament who have given some thought to these questions all agreed on this criterion.

The Council of Ministers does not need to be strengthened, it needs to become more transparent and to be reformed, so that the doors of the Council are also thrown open to the public.
I should just like to remind the honourable Member of the different roles of the various institutions of the European Union.
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.
In other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve.
Slovenia will be ready for accession by the end of 2002, and believes that it will then be welcome in the club of EU Member States.


We must therefore ensure that we do not tend towards harmonising these social conditions of manufacturing to the lowest common denominator, and, instead, let us pursue, as a priority, the objective of better product quality, without GMOs or pesticides or anything else. Developing better quality products will cause a consequent increase in demand, and thus in the volume of production, with a concomitant reduction in prices!
The Council of Agricultural Ministers is waiting for our decision and a postponement would not be a good idea.

It should certainly be emphasised that this is mainly due to the fact that the Commission is the institution that makes the most decisions directly affecting citizens.
My second reason is that the resolution does not clarify the concept of "disturbance" and the legal discussion, which is so deliberately vague that legal battles could be revived, which might lead to bans on traditional hunts where these are authorised under the Birds Directive and the subsidiary law in the states.
I would urge that a correct Danish translation of the text be obtained, for I find it a very serious matter that, in point 8 concerning Austria, these two mistakes have been made which, from a political point of view, completely alter the sense.

In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition.
Its starting point is the European Year Against Racism 1997 but the context has moved on significantly.
This is how it was described in your document and I think that this clause should be retained.
im new to linux. im thinking of installing mandrake10.1 cos they say this is the easiest. pls tell me what ubuntu can offer... plss


hello thar


In the world of networks traditional jurisdiction-based disputes-resolution procedures are of no real help to consumers and traders when things go wrong.
The Commission' s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment has evaluated the risks posed by a number of phthalates and has thereby unanimously established that the two phthalates that are far and away the most common in toys and articles used in childcare are in danger of causing the limit values to be exceeded in the case of young children and of causing health problems.

The nature and importance of the social dialogue accompanying these transformations goes hand in hand with the extent of restructuring or technological evolution.

We must avoid a situation where different bodies responsible for fighting fraud and corruption, such as OLAF and the financial irregularities panel, cancel each other out in their efforts.

However, we must not forget that, up until today, there have been more than 400 deaths as a result of the Intifada, which has taken us back to a situation which we thought we would never see again.


It clearly ought, too, to be regulated at European Union level.

I repeat, we are better at delivering assistance now than we were a decade ago, but it is intensely frustrating that all the assistance should be required in the first place.
What we need, however, is many small projects.
Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved.
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.


We have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the RELEX Commissioners share responsibility for programming - we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation - we think the present split has not worked well.



So I call on the older generations to help the young and to give them and, hence, the whole farming industry the same chance which they had.

Anyone at the UN last week, like myself, would know that, in the end, we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document. The difficulties were immense.
Trains are shorter and overloaded, and the safety of railways has declined.
Well, they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe.
I hope everybody has heard that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.

I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.

We cannot afford, as we did in 1998, to spend EUR 30.4 billion only to find that unemployment is increasing again in the poorer regions.
We do, however, deplore the fact that not once does this report mention the obvious link between the massive illegal immigration afflicting this continent and the explosion of undeclared work.
Madam President, I rise to speak on the same matter.
We are talking about a population of around 230 million people which, given the current rate of growth, will reach 300 million in 10 or 12 years time.

They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States.
I highlight this - we also have extremely intensive debates in the Member States on state quotas, which are between 40 and 50% - in order to illustrate the fact that the European budget accounts for 1.07% of the total gross national product.



anir: games that you would want to play are usuall closed source, so it is more up to the developers




This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.

To this end we will have to change certain laws, such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general, on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy.


Before I conclude, I would like to say something briefly about the EU-India Summit.
So, to pick up on something very important which Mr Patten said, peace is not enough, we also need to monitor what happens, to see what the scenario is once an agreement has been reached, I think that the European Union should review its presence and involvement in the region.

Our friends in the Commission have to accept that you cannot use legal measures alone to solve every single problem.
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it? Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?
Sometimes, all it takes is to deploy the technical means, which are already in existence, yet people do not always have the political will to do this with any vigour.
I believe that all of this has serious consequences for the degree of acceptance of the EU by those on the inside and also for the expectations which the eastern European countries have of us.



But the question of labour law and working hours is also important.

Subject: Culture and the WTO The Portuguese Presidency has emphasised the role of culture in the European project and has linked it, in particular, to the need to clarify the European strategy for the future WTO Round.
2005-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	kergan	fb stands for fram buffer
I did not hear that bell and I would ask you to confirm the method used in such cases, for this probably adversely affected the result of the vote in this Chamber.
Mr President, the Council does not have any information, rumours aside, on any representations made by Turkey to the Greek Government on 10 May 2000.



The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0178/2000) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark with a view to the adoption of a Council Framework Decision on combating serious environmental crime [5343/2000 - C5-0078/2000 - 2000/0801(CNS)]
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.
We therefore need to make a much greater effort than might be considered necessary, because the situation has been truly exceptional.
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.
However, this situation should not lead to debilitating mutual recriminations or imputations.
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?
It has highlighted the close and complex interaction between government policies and the environmental impact of livestock production, and identified a large number of technologies which are available to mitigate the negative effects in all different production modes, provided the appropriate policy framework is in place.
I am pleased to see that discharge has been granted to Parliament.
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.


This is something very close to my heart: learning to have an active command of foreign languages should not become the umpteenth barrier to the integration of this target group, a privilege for the already privileged members of our society.
- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have fundamental objections, based on the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, to EU funds being used in any way to develop, produce or market what are known as European films and film training.




In response to our questions, we received only inadequate information, for which we had to wait a long time.



Sixteen million people are starving today; 15 000 tonnes have been delivered.
There are also other matters which I would like to stress, which do not appear in the proposal on prices, such as my concern for the nut sector, hazelnuts and almonds, which is facing such great problems at the moment, since, in some cases, the improvement plans implemented by the Commission are coming to an end.
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.


Someone pointed out the fact that we need 100 million migrant workers in this Union over the next 25 years if we are to maintain economic growth and meet our social obligations.



B5­0081/2001 by Mr Markov and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the visa regime in force between Georgia and Russia.
I believe this is where the traditional railways must really rise to the challenge of pushing through the opening-up of the market that we have created.
In practice it means that, for example, no export refunds will be granted for the milk part of fruit yoghurt.
(DE) The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 19 (third part). Amendments Nos 3, 4, 16, 19 (fourth part), 22, 25, 30 (of which the first and third part).
The mechanism is wholly a Community instrument, and so is the origin of its budget.

After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making. Quite the reverse, in fact.

What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women? How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?





The southern railway in Austria is an old stretch of line and is of regional importance.


Austria has undeniably been a country that has met its European Union obligations.
It is a disgrace for Parliament that other committees can apparently acquire excellent secretariats and well-equipped secretariats with many staff, but that this is not possible for the Women' s Committee.

Regulations - that is, either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing - have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s.
This phenomenon falls under the heading of social and fiscal dumping, but the Commission, for all its high principles, does nothing to combat it.



Certainly, we must now realise that EU Community law has become a term in its own right, and that this must be analogous to the evolving definition of the term 'European Union' .
But completion of the Petersberg tasks must be guaranteed and the principle that security is indivisible must be applied, which is why mutual support, as anchored in Article 5 of the WEU Treaty, must be open to all sides in a revised EU Treaty.
Pozac: this will get better in hoary
macewan, compiling is not needed on ubuntu
All too often Eurocontrol is used as the scapegoat and is blamed for the present situation, but the real blame must lie with the inaction of national governments in the areas that I have outlined.
We recall that on 20 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait in a unilateral act of aggression that was universally condemned.
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.

I have not received this document, but I take it that what you say is true.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect the priorities of European policy in the budget of the European Union, that is the objective of this highly premature debate on the budget 2001.




They did not, in general, relate to matters concerned with the Internet - this new technology, which has come in at an enormous pace in the last few years; a new technology which has the ability to do good things but also the ability to do evil things.
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.
The Commission's efforts will be integrated into our wider programme of support in the Balkans with respect to health and the environment, because we must look at the accumulated effects.


The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.



Moreover, the United States have never liberalised their own air traffic control, as this is managed by a single state agency.
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before coming to the main subject of my address on behalf of the Commission this morning, I should, with your permission, like to raise one point very briefly.

However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.
It is our task to ensure that this technology is used responsibly, not to prevent it.
At the time, the Commission probably underestimated the problem and did not adopt the necessary measures to prevent the disease spreading.
If we really want to help the countries devastated by the hurricane, then of course we need to do more than just implement a few aid projects on the ground.
I take the view that in the event of administrative error which leads to losses in customs revenue, a different regime should apply in future to the one currently in force, i.e. it is the Member States themselves that should be liable for the loss of revenue in the event of error.
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.

Furthermore, some Member States are particularly unwilling to undertake the mutual exchange of information concerning fraud. Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud, for example, to the Commission.

Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy.
Developing the strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine is another priority of the French Presidency, which is due to host the EU/Ukraine Summit in Paris in 10 days' time and the EU/Russia Summit on 30 October.

In addition, some improvements are needed within the sector itself as well.
Mr President, I wanted to express my concern as some facts are liable to be misinterpreted.
During the hearing held by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we took on board the concerns of the representatives of American consumers regarding the inadequacy of the American protection system and we also noted the need, expressed by President Clinton, for the United States to introduce an organic law on the protection of personal data.
smurfix: ah ok, I just wanted to .il one to have consistent look with the main one.

In my opinion, and I say this on behalf of the Group, that was very much a missed opportunity.


Only in this way, acting fairly, will we achieve a Europe which lives in peace and prosperity, which is the founding aim of our Community and I believe that this is still our greatest aspiration.

Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations, then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good, healthy and proper debate.
I would say that, given the political importance of the Moroccan question, strict adherence to protocol on the agenda is of secondary importance.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m.
All the statistics show that migratory flows have not diminished and that they will even increase over the coming years.

One of the important issues raised within the discussions at conciliation and also within the report itself is in clearing up some of the wording used.


It therefore becomes important not only to learn how to be efficient in implementing these guidelines but also to be aware of potential obstacles to their implementation, and always proceed in the knowledge that the Community also has an objective in terms of employment.

The development of school curricula and the preparation of textbooks are the responsibility of the Palestinian Centre for Curriculum Development.

I am happy to say that all bodies there are democratically elected, but very undemocratic habits still remain in these Central American countries.

How can one reasonably demand ever lower prices in the sacred name of competition without challenging current requirements regarding nuclear safety?


tuggy1: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats, please don't spread FUD
Finally, we would like the report for next year to take account of the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In this way, from next year, we will have a report in line with the real situation which will allow a country-by-country and right-by-right analysis to be carried out due to the simultaneous preparation of this Charter.
Mr Chirac also told us that one of the most interesting aspects to be dealt with by the French Presidency would be the reconciliation of family life and working life.





More specifically, if you are thinking of the changeover from the transitional arrangements for levying VAT to the final arrangements, which would involve changing the points of taxation, we have clearly indicated that this matter would in any case be decided by unanimous decision, and I can confirm this.

Firstly, by improving the training of Community officials intended to be involved in carrying out external actions.
My amendment followed on from existing wording about training, and merely added that workers should be made aware of their own responsibilities for safety together with those of their fellow workers.
In fact, the large plants, as stipulated in the IPPC Directive, will continue to be obliged to be included in the EMAS register, since they will have to abide by the environmental legislation in force - Amendment No 12 - which obviously includes compliance with the IPPC Directive in the cases where companies are affected.

On the contrary, this form of evaluation should allow each establishment, however different in terms of its students or the methods or resources used, to meet all the risks of dropping out, to improve the intrinsic quality of education for everyone and to accept all pupils of all abilities by offering education which is tailored to the students' requirements and by allowing everyone to discover their own personal development needs.
As far as we are concerned, the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment, stable, permanent and full employment, protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers.
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.

good old microsoft's attitude of wanting to be the only o/s on the hdd



I feel that it would be more destabilising for the regime to return to a more comfortable situation in terms of trade, to a situation in which the people have at least some hope of happiness, rather than to continue with the embargoes which, at this stage, are not succeeding in overthrowing the regime, but are simply inflicting enormous suffering on the people and, in particular, on Iraqi children.



It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.

hopefully that'll actually work
What is the difference between a .tar file and a .bz2 file format ?



Now, I personally own over 4 000 books, and, although this is hardly a knowledge revolution in itself, it is some indication, on a personal level extrapolated to a political level, of the pace of change in how knowledge is accessed, distributed, applied and refined.
Either we have a European Union based on law or we do not.

Further evidence of the importance we attach to this subject can be found in the fact that it was the Commission which undertook the initiative to include a specific article on children's rights into the charter of fundamental rights.
This is not the way, in my view, to formulate development policy nor is it the way to bring about the urgently needed reconciliation of national development policies.

More specifically concerning Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 25, the Commission cannot accept them as they stand but is willing to consider how due account can be taken of the concerns they reflect.
Even if one cannot but applaud the decision to adopt specific measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination on the labour market, which might affect asylum seekers whom life has already, by definition, treated badly, we still need to keep a legal conception of this notion: to put it plainly, where there is every reason to help asylum seekers who follow the correct procedure and are duly recognised as such, the same does not apply to the numerous categories listed in the report, namely applicants, those under temporary protection and those denied refugee status and threatened with repatriation, for whom the report makes provision for identical assistance.
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics.


The commitment to reduce world poverty to half its present levels by 2015 was reiterated.
I, too, am of the opinion that, since the Fifth Environmental Action Programme adopted a principally sectorial approach to environmental policy, it may be that, when discussing the sixth, we ought to place greater emphasis on the involvement of social and economic players such as local authorities in the achievement of the objectives, so that the safeguarding of our environment increasingly becomes an element to be integrated into the overall planning stage.


In this context, it is essential to prevent a climate of political vendetta arising between the main institutions of the Union.

The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms, and threatening to do the same with the mines, will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe.
It is urgent, Mr President, because the European Parliament' s mission took place last February and so far we have not been able to reach any final conclusions.


oh lol


We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits; they should be.

We would have liked the European Union to exploit the methods of democratic persuasion afforded due to the aid it provides to all the Southern Cone countries in order to encourage the legitimate government in Paraguay to show greater respect for human rights.
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.
The second argument is that there must be no distortions of competition in the Community.

Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.

That is why we want to start having a much more determined political dialogue with the United States on this issue and press for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the United States.

While incineration is getting a lot of adverse publicity, and recent planning decisions in Ireland have certainly raised the crucial question of the location of incinerators, it is difficult to envisage a complete programme of waste disposal without incineration, particularly in relation to toxic waste, and in this regard consideration must be given to finding locations where the facility will not impact badly on the natural environment.
Thank you very much, Mr Salafranca, for that clarification.
The fact is, over the years, more and more additives have been used in foodstuffs, in connection, in particular, with the industrialisation of food production.
anir: thats the only thing we really can't help you with, unless you like ut2k4 or doom3 :)

Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.
Negligence in transposing Community law in the past did not have the same repercussions as it has on a single economic area in which the idea of not having a uniform legal Community order at the same moment in time is inconceivable



No administration or institution is infallible.


I would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions, your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented.
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.


I think that might be stretching the Commissioner's powers a little bit.

Naturally, these too should be held free from discrimination based on race or ethnic origin.
This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House.
If the method now being chosen takes hold, it will kill off flax and hemp cultivation, which are an ecological form ideally suited to disadvantaged areas.
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.
The fact of the matter is that there is public reporting of the results which are carried out by each national standards authority within every Member State of the European Union.
I was responsible for the preparations for this second reading.
The need for professional qualifications acquired in individual Member States to be seen as equivalent also cut clear across the political divide.
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.

As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.
As I have already said, I believe that this debate requires collective action and that you, as Members of Parliament, can play a decisive role in relations with the scientific community and industry. Rest assured that I and the other members of the Commission will be ready to pursue this dialogue and this debate tomorrow.
Unfortunately however, this whole period has been characterised by a conspicuous absence of peace.
When they meet in Nice, they could abolish the right of veto in European justice policy.
All in all, from Socialist Africa to ultraliberal Africa, from the European Development Fund to the World Bank, from the summits in Bujumbura, Addis-Ababa, Nairobi, Casablanca, and now, on 3 April, Cairo, it is always the same assessment, the same threesome of poverty, epidemic and massacre.

Although it was found in the 1980s that very large quantities of phthalates caused liver tumours in rats and mice, official agencies in Europe and the United States have not confirmed that phthalates present a risk of cancer in humans.


That does not prevent me and my group from campaigning, in the future too, for a situation in which ethical limits upon medical research and therapy are all complied with.



The Commission' s proposal for the CARDS programme is explicit and our group supports it.

The proportion of the complaints outside the mandate even increased slightly, probably because we received a growing number of complaints by e-mail.

Finally, the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not, as in the past, interfere in their responsibilities, and that when the Commission takes national governments to task, it can rely on our support.

It took over a month to allocate it to a rapporteur and then, because of the summer recess, it was not possible to programme the internal debate and discussion until October and November.


First is the definition of public service.
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.
Traffic on the Verona-Munich route is increasing, yet only one third of the capacity of the existing railway line is being used.
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.




I recognise that this is not a matter that is affected by the budget on this occasion, but we should not ignore the changes we are seeing in the energy sphere with Save and Altener.
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.
Secondly, when can we expect the proposals for a new policy for the horizontal agreements, a new policy that has also been announced by the Commission?
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.

Parliament' s struggle to ensure the safety of children is very worthwhile in a Union that often just concentrates on hard values.




It undermines both fair play and genuine competition, and endangers the sportspeople who indulge in it.

No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.




debian is the only one that has had a problem with it.
I would make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to make a maximum effort to improve the quality of legislation and to restrict the administrative burden on citizens and businesses.
Subject: Support for European films European films are highly important to the cultural diversity and the cultural heritage both of the individual countries and of Europe.

Madam President, I voted against the Watson report, as did the whole of the Group of the European People' s Party, not just because the amendments tabled by the group - of which I have the pleasure of being a member - were not adopted, but also because the pensioners are tired of seeing European Union territory increasingly filling up with third-country nationals who do not have the means to live.


The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended.




She also failed to deal with issues such as coherency with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had.


have you checked shipit.ubuntu.com?


The malpractice of many fishing activities should be taken into account because it is also an environmental crime which has long-term consequences.

It wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules, and that is not acceptable.
The translation of these versions must be amended.


Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported Mr Sterckx' s report in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as it will support it in plenary.


Mr Stevenson mentioned that exports from East Europe are increasing: we are now expanding the area of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe.
We are discussing a Commission communication on the revitalisation of the Barcelona process, which everybody recognises to be extremely important.



However, we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead.

I must emphasise the fact that, since Tampere, the Commission has already proposed a number of legislative instruments, so that they can be discussed by the Council and adopted within the deadlines that have been established by the scoreboard.



"Prevention is better than cure" , as Hippocrates said all those years ago, thereby paving the way for preventive medicine. This is particularly true today, given that there is no cure either for BSE or for the equivalent human disease, the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
There is no strategic approach which draws a clear distinction between asylum and immigration, which regulates both appropriately and which deals with the important issue of burden-sharing, and all of this gives rise to problems.
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.

That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.

Let us not fool ourselves, financial independence is essential to guaranteeing functional independence.
Professor MacCormick will be acutely aware of this in Scotland, with its own legal heritage.

i thoght so



Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.
We have new, much clearer language on the state's duty to end violence against women, including domestic violence, and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women.


I should like to close by thanking the rapporteur for his sterling work and his willingness to cooperate during the procedure to examine and supplement his report in committee and I should like to pass on to you this succinct and, to my mind, rather dramatic appeal by a farmer in my region. As he said so very simply yet so very forcefully on hearing of the achievements of our Union: "Europe yes, but a Europe for all the Europeans of the Union" .
These values, however, are the result of a political compromise between states, and the results of the model used by the Commission have been overlooked.
We have a good reputation there.


I will now turn to your report Mr Staes, for which the Commission is in your debt.
Let me start by making a positive comment.
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.
The conclusions of the Lisbon European Council specify national actions which are therefore the responsibility of the national governments. These are objective commitments which the governments assumed in signing these conclusions and which involve the reorientation of the mechanisms and structures and action plans and programmes which exist within the European Union.
Firstly, we think it is unacceptable that women should suffer social prejudice or discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity issues;

Will it indicate who in the Commission is responsible for this failure to follow accepted practice on the publication of all minutes, reports and agreed statements by scientific committees, and will it indicate who was responsible for delaying the publication of the main minutes of the CSTEE meeting of 25 November 1999 until April 2000?
Indeed, in Northern Ireland last year, we only had, I think, three identifiable cases of BSE and the projection for this year is one or at worst maybe two.



Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.



Then the Chinese will have to discuss and not just protest.

I have a problem with this.
Surely it is not right for individual measures in Member States to be eroded by Europe through the back door.
At long last, it puts the problem of common foreign policy back in its natural context, by which I mean the geographical context, i.e. physical space, the confrontation of land and sea, the grouping of nations in terms of their own areas of activity, their own bonds and their own community of interests, even if these are focused away from those of the mythical Europe, a continent so intangible that it does not have any real borders.

I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.
- (DA) Agricultural aid is a heavy burden for the European Union.
Having only got what we consider minor concessions, we can confirm that, as British Conservatives, we neither support the Working Time Directive nor its extension to any other grouping.
Then we stand back proud and happy that we have solved the problem.





The restriction on the development of this programme is not lack of will on our part - I want to make that clear - but to some extent a lack of resources and also a certain reluctance on the part of the Member States to respond to our invitation to second diplomats to the delegations.
The second point I would like to make in this connection is that, since every year, we have some money left in the agricultural budget, it should be possible to use this money the year after i.e. to earmark it and not to return it.
I think, Mr Blokland, you could have done that without actually announcing it to Parliament, but never mind.

If something else were going on, then we must have heard about it through the grapevine because over the past few weeks, rumour had it that some aspects were useless, that certain appointments or certain people had not been transferred and that some of them did not come up to scratch.




I have every confidence in Jacques Chirac, President-in-Office of the Council, and in his ability, along with our partners within the European Union, to meet these historic challenges.
I think we must place this report, and also the directive which is in the pipeline, in the context of the European Union' s energy policy with its three objectives of competitive pricing, security of supply and environmental protection.

The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 as far as comitology is concerned for the reasons that I have already identified.

It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.

Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, Mr Solbes, I share the satisfaction Mr Radwan expressed in his report regarding the importance of the objective of maintaining price stability, which the Central Bank achieved by bringing the rate of inflation in the euro area down to minimal levels.



We really hope and believe so.

9. Makes it compulsory to publish an annual environmental report on compliance with limit values.
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.


I understand the importance of your assessments, but we must abide by the Rules of Procedure.

It is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone.
I think that our position, and my position, is that there is a middle way which will allow us to move forward, but it must be clearly defined; we must be clear as to how we are going to bring about the liberalisation of the market, whereby the railways must, of course, be given a chance to adapt to the new conditions one step at a time.
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament.
As the Spanish saying goes, which is very much in agreement with this regulation, 'Esto son lentejas; si quieres las tomas y si no las dejas' [ 'here are some lentils, take them or leave them' ].
crimsun, ok i was just hoping a dev to be here and the things going easier... thanks anyway
Last year the EU decided to grant financial aid to Montenegro to the tune of EUR 15 million for political reasons, free of any conditions connected with the prevention of smuggling.

Minister, Commissioner, you have truly disappointed me.
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.
The construction of Europe is based on the mutual trust that exists between Member States and the mutual recognition of similar levels of protection regarding fundamental rights, legislation and basic principles.


We thereupon refrained from tabling an amendment that also refers to problems in regard to the Socialist Group.
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.
. It is a correct policy objective of the European Union to ensure that businesses carry out their affairs in an environmentally-friendly manner.
You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed.


All the 12 key sectors are important and they must be tackled, given the sexual discrimination which exists in all areas, and since lack of progress in one sector will inevitably have repercussions on the other sectors.
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.



This is a very serious matter, Mr President, and it should be explicitly condemned, as Mrs Napoletano said - but I do not want to be drawn into a lengthy discussion here - we must find out who invited these delinquents to Parliament.
Today we have created a situation in which the principles of the rule of law are still upheld, but in which legal practitioners remain bound to secrecy if they are either representing their clients before a court or advising them on a legal matter.


Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.
We consider that a critical revision of copyright ownership rights needs to be carried out in such a way as to facilitate and increase the transparency of the transmission of knowledge and products, and, on this point, the companies and the large corporations know that they will have to come to an agreement with the Web.
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.

No, we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute.


I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications.
The result is that the European Parliament should officially take note of the decree withdrawing Mr Le Pen' s mandate only after expiry of the deadline for appealing to the French Council of State or, if applicable, after a decision by the latter' .
Any Member State which intends to take national measures must, of course, report them to the Commission and the Commission constantly checks what is going on in order to discourage distortions of competition.



I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.





The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.

These should not only qualify for an eco-label, but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market.
hoary hedgehog?
Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality, I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and, as I have no speaking time left, Mr President, I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say, because as draftsperson of the Committee' s opinion and as a speaker on the second report, it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes.



We should therefore be pleased about this and hope that this work continues, so that cases of fraud can be reduced rather than merely stabilised.
I have also watched with concern in the past year the tendency of the present leaders of Russia - many of whom are ex-KGB because they were appointed by a former colonel in the KGB - to be a little bit trigger-happy in the arrest of so-called British, American and Russian spies.


Finally, I would call for the NGOs, in particular, to be given a key role, because it is they who are promoting awareness, and this is something which needs to be done not only among women, but also among men.
That, indeed, represents half of the European budget.



I am also quite happy to concede that there are health, nutrition and social policy objectives here.




Good administration can create conditions for active citizenship, whereas maladministration can undermine these conditions.

Among the resolutions on particular themes, the EU will, in the future too, take responsibility for the resolutions concerning the rights of the child and the death penalty.
For the rest, as President, I am at your service at the moment and I, together with yourself, need to apply the Rules of Procedure to the best of my ability.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.
The trans-European transport networks, and the 14 specific projects in particular, have not succeeded in any of the aims they were in fact intended to achieve, even though a great deal of money has already been invested.

To conclude, I wish to thank Neil Parish for his outstanding work on this report.

However, we should note that the response of BNFL to the nuclear inspectorate report has already resulted in very significant management changes.

We wholeheartedly reject the call for dialogue and the meekness that both lead to dictatorships and concentration camps.

In Nice, prior to the great enlargement, I would ask you, please, to see this text as anticipating events.

Let me refer, by way of example, to Mr Khanbhai' s report, which revealed some problems in the ECSC accounts, including, among other things, the solvency ratio and the transfer of property, although the Commission and the High Authority are currently reducing these problems with a view to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002.
Candidate countries and their Members of Parliament, and I am thinking of many a member of the Turkish parliament, have a great deal to learn, such as how independent representatives of the people act and must act when it comes to human rights in their own country.

Disparate initiatives by individual Member States will always be incomplete and, what is more, less productive than those on which we stand united.

pitti: DING DONG DANG!
However, I would express my satisfaction at the fact that so much attention has been devoted to the way in which the EC Court of Justice operates.



The number of undernourished people in black Africa rose from 90 million in 1970 to 180 million in 1995.
The prohibition of night work for women is a right acquired by the working movement in France.
Other EU countries' average is ten times lower HTV taxes.
After all, crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century.


Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.
I have already received satisfied feedback, not only from fish, but also from human pensioners, for it is right to protect the young, even if they are only fish, as is the case here.
We consider the Commission' s initiative to be an important one.
We should not produce empty shells; our citizens would see through them straight away anyway.
The constant harping on at summits and in other Union institutions about the need to reduce the famous "non-wage labour costs" is encouraging companies to implement this reactionary approach on their own initiative, by generalising undeclared work and extending it to a surprisingly large number of workers.

Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.

Mr President, I thank Mrs Hieronymi for the work she has put into this report.
Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today, Commissioner Wallström, that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on.

Finally, I am also against donating tax money to European syndicates of political parties and against filling vacancies for interpreters in a way which offers newcomers a poor legal position.
anyware

Twelve European countries are before the European Court.


We only provide 50% of the supply, for the rest we depend on other countries.
Unfortunately, it has proved impossible so far to take the same drastic steps in this House.
We challenge the Council and the Commission once again to include it, not as a priority for six months, but as a goal for the EU, as important as the goal of enlarging or deepening the European Union.

Firstly, the funding of foreign policy measures for the 2000/2001 financial year, which is what we are discussing here, is not in any way linked to the setting of sugar prices.
He is afraid that millions of immigrants will come to Germany if the directive comes into force.

These propose a direct right of taxation for the EU in this area, together with the standardisation of national legislation on country planning.
We are also very committed to diversifying and looking at different sources of funding as befits our new entrepreneurial era.

When the debate about Austria - which has many elements, many complexities - was unfolding we realised that on the edges of Austria there were significant candidate countries which, while they were making progress in economic, progress in social aspects, represented a real problem with regard to their treatment of minorities.
What is more, that may be an underestimate.


However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.
I wish to put on record the British Conservative support for Mr Ferri's report which we feel finds an acceptable compromise between the various conflicting interests.
Having experienced many vicissitudes and a period of paralysis with regard to the projects financed by this programme, the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament finally formalised an agreement specifically on a budgetary framework of EUR 640 million for the period 2000-2004.


This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.

My second question to the presidency is therefore the following: What initiatives regarding a 'Tobin tax' are you planning during your presidency?
We are of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies.





A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.


One of the measures recommended by the draft resolution is the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, with jurisdiction over the whole Union.

Furthermore, the Commission and the Council should set minimum conditions which may seem strict to some, but which will allow working conditions to be improved and the health and safety of workers to be protected, harmonising legislation in a market operating with the free movement of workers.
The Commission clearly cannot ignore the fact that, when it holds commercial negotiations, its concessions have effects which sometimes turn out to be negative.

In order to provide efficient aid, it is vital for the European Commission, the EU Member States and other donors to dovetail their policies.
We have, however, received an initial outline of the proposals.

Finally, I find it absurd to demand that only women be trained to take on leading roles and to take decisions when many men, who already have such roles and jobs, would greatly benefit from such training.


However, it has to be recognised that even if negotiations had progressed so far that the declaration of statehood was non-controversial, the future of Jerusalem was always going to re-ignite controversy once again.

This was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession. I understand their action, and I can certainly not say as much for Mr Atkins, whose report urges the Commission to encourage Member State governments that currently tolerate a situation where national labour disputes disrupt air traffic to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency" .
The first is the matter with which we are occupied at present, namely trying to ensure that we get the better both of BSE and of TSE, which is, of course, a broader concept.




When, in the early 80s, the full extent of the problem of Aids became clear, the Western world adopted a large number of policies in order to curb the illness and provide sound treatment to those who had contracted the disease.
Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.
Regulation No 3582/86 is about the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and Regulation No 2158/92 has established a framework for the protection of forests against fires.
Mr President, in recent years criminal organisations within and outside Europe have set up powerful international networks which make huge profits from, for example, trafficking in women or drugs.
The Environment Committee has taken the logical step that the Commission avoided.
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.

We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.
The report states that the initiative was poorly planned, that it contains no justification section, that it was prepared without organisations such as ECRE or UNHCR being consulted and that the relationship between the principles of readmission between the Member States and the principles of readmission to third countries is not made clear.

The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.
I have drawn the Turkish Government' s, the Turkish parties' and the Turkish parliament' s attention to the role of the European Parliament in ensuring that no political compromises are made with candidates during access negotiations and in Turkey' s preparations for access negotiations which contradict the Copenhagen criteria.

We need more than just a rehashed explanation. What we need is the adoption of measures that will guarantee the protection of fishermen and the rights of shipowners who are caught up in this situation, as is currently happening in Portugal.

The scorn for human dignity that has been displayed is nothing more than the result of the unbridled materialism on which Communism in particular and revolutionary ideology in general are based.
It is actually not so much a matter of improving safety checks on these flags of convenience, as stipulated in the resolution, as actually working right now to eliminate their existence.
Have they not learnt the lessons of the past?

Mr President, Commissioner, my question does not concern the timetable; instead I would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement.

The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.


2) The increased effectiveness of the measures contained in Directive 89/552/ÅEC on 'Television without Frontiers' , concerning the promotion of European works.
lostmonk: can you run the "check cd" step?




We disagree with the imposition of quotas on political parties because they are organisations which people join voluntarily and they alone have the right to decide on their structure and how they operate.
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.
Unfortunately it was closed too late.
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.
I feel this should be acknowledged.


As the House knows, I - as the Commissioner responsible - presented an anti-discrimination package a few months ago, containing two directives and a programme.
Finally, I would like to point out that this directive sets out the minimum requirements, and governments retain the right to put in place better conditions for the reunification of families.


For this we need uniform worldwide crimes and definitions so that law enforcement authorities can work together in global terms and not in opposition.
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.
As far as promoting ornamental plants is concerned - or to be more precise, Mrs Redondo, publicity for the ornamental plants sector - it is true that the Commission is carrying out a review here.

It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters.


Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.

i orderd them aroung turkey day


Aside from that, let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report.

The present system, in which it takes various signatures to authorise payments, does away with the notion of personal responsibility.
In the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives concluded between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in May 1999, Parliament and the Council decided to call on the Commission, in view of developments in the Balkans, to submit the necessary budgetary proposals, if necessary in the form of a proposal to revise the financial perspectives.
Complementary measures and cooperation with the business community, and fiscal measures, these are the key words of a more effective policy intended to increase the financial resources and to improve the marketing and distribution.

srbaker: f-spot is very unstable unless you get it from cvs
Madam President, I agree with Mrs Carlotti that the merit of the Durban conference was to make it clear that Aids is not being fought in the same way in Europe and in Africa.
We must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible. I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too.
At EU level, this means, for example, that our policy should not encourage countries to survive on the basis of just one product.
what are your stats coming from/


We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .





I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.

I am then often ashamed at how little influence we can exert as a huge economic power in the political field.
Mr President, the present proposal reinforces, improves upon and tightens up on the voluntary eco-labelling system which has existed in the EU since 1992 and which has not, unfortunately, been as successful as had been hoped.
It is high time that we laid down a comprehensive regulation which is easy to monitor and which ensures that shipping waste is collected and processed at ports in an environmentally-friendly manner.
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.
some users of webcam here ?
We should be able to promote without delay harmonisation measures which respond to technological and market developments.

The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly.


I should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000.

However, if enlargement towards the East is inevitable, how can we explain that enlargement should only happen in one direction, taking us further away from the Mediterranean, which is so near by, forgetting how near the countries of the Maghreb are, some of which enjoy a special association status with the European Union, and that our future is intimately connected with theirs.

Of course, there are other structures which are public nuisances - landfill waste sites, for example, which are created from old quarries with no planning - but, in the case of airports, we see the consequences every day, or rather we hear them, for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes.

This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.
I would not presume to say which solution is better but we must find the courage to consider all sides of the issue.
The Commission certainly needs to work even more closely with us and to step up the pace of its involvement.
Are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving Paddington Station?

Even though the Algerian people displayed remarkable resistance in order to reject fundamentalism, the amnesty for such murders - described by some as crimes against humanity - and the lack of punishment enforced upon the perpetrators of these crimes appear to have exonerated them to the point that they are continuing their murderous work.
The fact that in the recently formed new states of Eastern Europe, the language of workers and farmers has become the language of the state and education, forms part of the necessary democratisation process but should not go hand in hand with discriminating against, and even driving out, minorities living within the particular state' s territory.
Because of the very limits that Mr Huhne talked about, this is, of course, very closely controlled by the Council's proposed waiver and particularly by some of the sensible compromises suggested earlier.

The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/2000) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues.

Yes, Commissioner, it is a draft document, and you know that it will soon be going through the Spanish Parliament.
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.

Any sourceforge users around here? I tried registering this morning (twice!) and I still haven't gotten the confirmation letter. It's been about 12 hours already. Is this normal?
We will therefore propose a new recital and changes to Article 9, which will ensure that effects on smaller Member States are properly taken into account on review.
The EU has a comparative advantage in regional integration that Africa can benefit from, and we will ensure it benefits from it in the coming years, when the organisation of regional economic cooperation will dominate the agenda in Africa.



Thousands of them are still dependent on food aid to survive.

It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.
These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General.
i've got it working on the slackware install i did for my brother waaaay back
Remember, too, the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and remember the Convention for the International War Crimes Tribunal, which only Italy has ratified.
did you take this one on?
We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.


What they are proposing to us today spells the death of the common good and, over and above that, of the very meaning of life; for they are concerned only with human rights and have forgotten what man is first and foremost, and what his roots and aspirations are.

I would like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that this is, of course, by no means the intention.

This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions.

Furthermore; it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects, such as administrative formalities and documents, customs and embarkation procedures, to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another.
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.
We have to have better information networks, we have to have this exchange of information horizontally, not coming into the centre and going out again.
I should add that I asked the Commission back in August about a particular comment in the report, which stated that in August there would be some feedback from SMEs about their response to the project.

I believe that we have managed to achieve this.

i have 150 running and still only takeing  2/3 of my ram
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.

The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice.

I agree with him that we should urgently implement the Kyoto Agreement.

A sensible, multiannual cod recovery plan embracing realistic technical conservation measures, the closure of cod spawning grounds and the decommissioning of the larger new fishing vessels will surely be more sensible than the pursuit of a plan which would allow industrial fishing to continue in vast restricted zones and which would potentially lead to the bankruptcy of half the Scottish fleet.
I believe that that is also what we need in the future: for learning to be fun.

Our group has faith in the Mediterranean, and wants the European Union to accord to it the strategic, economic and political importance it once had.



There is an application before the Court.
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.

So let me say straight away that you, Mr Schmitt, have carried out what I see as an exemplary piece of work.

I am very happy to inform honourable Members that the Commission can agree to the amendments that have been put forward.






The provisions proposed will be unable to protect the safety and health of workers effectively, given that there are still numerous exemptions and long transitional periods for implementing the directive.
Above all, we must ensure that these provisions take the absorption capacity of each Member State into account.
First of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Monti for having had the courtesy to consult the European Parliament.

That means approximately EUR 7 600 per hectare, approximately EUR 7 600 per farmer.
First: the scant and insufficient coordination of the Member States with regard to issues that must be addressed jointly whenever the interests of the European Union are at stake, and the minimal cooperation between the delegations of the European Union.

We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, have two fundamental objectives as this new millennium commences.
The European Court of Justice should not have jurisdiction over areas already covered by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or by other international bodies.
We also hope that it will adopt a similarly rigorous approach where Time Warner and AOL are concerned.
Well, it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is, even today.



- (FR) I want to explain the reasons underlying my rejection of the annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union.
What we need is better control on the part of the authorities.

I nonetheless agree with Mrs Frahm about one thing, namely that EUR 26 million is far, far too low a level.

And Mrs Mann' s report mentioned, among the many other excellent projects, the European Institute in Washington supported by the Commission.

Nevertheless, the Commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place.
It was immoral to extend greater priority to the importance of trade interests over human rights and is in marked contrast to our approach in relation to the bilateral trade agreements we have with developing countries.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
However, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the Canadian Government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the NAFO.

Mr President, within our groups in Parliament and within the IGC itself we are still struggling with the problems that proved fairly intractable at Amsterdam.



do we have any members up for approval?

Where anarchy and lawlessness rule, the law of the most brutal party applies.
justin2: blame your ISP
The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account.
My fifth point is that this increased responsibility must also find expression with regard to groups in the European Parliament.
But in the South Africa case, we are ready to accept the EUR 5m threshold simply in order not to delay a decision.

****************************************************




The Convention has changed significantly for the better, in our view, due to the fact that not only cereals, but also other products, including local products, fish and vegetables, can qualify, transport and operational costs must be proportionate to the value and the least developed countries, in particular, will be able to apply for this aid.
I think I am right in saying that 160 nations decided to establish the international criminal court and the statute of the court was approved by about 120 states, so there should be no problem in moving from the 50 who have ratified to the 60 figure which we require in order to move things forward.



I have also talked to government representatives from both parties.


trukulo: thanks for your help with the theme
However, if the situation worsens to the extent that some of the commitments made by the European Union cannot be kept in accordance with the financial perspectives, then this mid-term revision may clearly occur, as specified in the financial perspectives and for the first time by qualified majority voting.
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.
Treenaks > how many mails did you sent? is it worth trying again? :)
That is good news, because pensioners like peace and quiet.


I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.

The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.





The information society requires increasing numbers of people with technological training, which women must get involved in, since this is an area for which they are particularly well-equipped.
Therefore when Mr De Clercq says why could the European Patent Office not become an agency of the European Union my answer is that the European Union must sign up to the European Patent Convention and should negotiate that but it is no longer realistic to expect the European Patent Office to become a Union agency.



Yes, of course, Mr President, we are also extremely worried about what has happened and that is why we are looking at the Seveso II directive in order to see if it is necessary to complement it with new rules to cover establishments like the plants involved in the recent accidents.





Many people have doubts about admitting Malta to the European Union.

Therefore we cannot tolerate having ineffective diplomats in situ.
That is clear. Are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote?


The EPP's amendments seek to divide families.
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.


The European Union should now pull out all the stops in order to make this embargo happen and to stop all trade in blood diamonds.
As the report indicates, we will have to invest in the necessary infrastructure and its management.

I saw one NGO which made an application for projects requiring eighty pages of budget sheets and so many supporting papers that one NGO application weighed over twelve kilos.


I particularly welcome the three-year review, because my only concern is that Member States should implement this legislation that they have now signed up to.
At the moment, the information is circulating without any guarantee.

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the Danish Government on taking the initiative to propose the Council framework decision that we are discussing, which aims to equip us with more effective tools for combating serious environmental crime.
In many cases, complaints against national, regional or local authorities could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman in the Member States concerned.
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.

Its author' s sole concern, under the guise of unifying energy markets in Europe, is to deliver this entire sector into the hands of private profit.
Madam President, I too would like to support Mr Tajani and all the other Members who have spoken on the subject in their condemnation of the racist attack on a Christian teacher of Jewish origin which has taken place in my country, in Verona to be precise.

What is the state of affairs, five years on, in Bosnia-Herzegovina?

It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.

And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.


Mr President, I accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now.

Before closing the debate, I invite the President-in-Office to reply to the debate or at least conclude it.
This question was raised in that document too.
We talked about the Pensioners' Party and he asked me whether I was content with the European Parliament.
(EL) There are serious reservations regarding the proposal to amend Regulation EC No 1251/1999 on flax and hemp grown for fibre because of the unfair allocation of quotas between the Member States.

Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts.
It subsequently issued the communication which we are examining today on the basis of the aforementioned public consultation.
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.


Of course, new digital technology offers an opportunity to democratise book reading, but it may also create an additional obstacle to literacy.
Their dedication and commitment will be needed in the future even more than ever and we must encourage successive generations to be optimistic and take their future into their own hands.
There was concern about the way the Summit was being managed - it did not even appear in the programme for the current six-month period - with moments of confusion, suspense and abundant rumour-mongering, which were incompatible with the seriousness and rigour which should be expected from the European Union given the importance of this historic meeting, the first to be held at the highest level between European and African leaders.
Thanks to their cooperation and with the help of all their other colleagues, I feel this is truly a much better regulation, and is a vast improvement on what the Commission originally presented to Parliament.

As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.

It was not the Commission which was responsible for this, but the governments.

The committee has worked with its usual efficiency and diligence and has supported its proposals with an impressive econometric analysis which I should like to praise here in public.
Mr President, Mr Väyrynen' s comments just now about concentric circles remind me a little of a hole with circles drawn round it, looking at Switzerland and Europe.

This is how I see the action plan; this is how I see our joint action.






The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.



In previous debates I referred to the need to reduce waste: here the manufacturers of food and consumer goods have an important role to play, particularly in relation to packaging in its various forms and the importance of using products compatible with recycling, which is of course my preferred option.
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.
This will send a bad signal to consumers.
It is also the best way to dispel idle fears, because people have to enlighten themselves, they have to talk, and they have to acquire knowledge and information.
- (FR) I welcome the EU-related aspects of the work carried out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Defence and Security Policy on the annual report on human rights.
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.
There is still no scientifically approved method for migration tests which could partly replace the proposed legislation, and no such method should therefore be alluded to in the legislative text.

Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied.




But at the same time we must also make it clear that Parliament and political bodies such as the Commission and the Council should not disregard the vote of experts.

Thank you again, Portuguese Presidency. We urge you to be present, active and vigilant in the matters which are important to you: some of them are very important to us too.

I should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission.

Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.
For the rest of my speech, I would refer to the written version which I have yet to publish.
It was maintained that HADEP was supporting and helping the PKK which has opted for peace rather than war.




I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.

No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.
Indeed the relative official silence, except perhaps in the case of foreigners, can only be regretted.


I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.


Finally, I would like say that the cement industry lobby should not be put in a competitive position that is better than that enjoyed by the hazardous waste disposal plants.
We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet.
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.

This seems to me to be indicative of a cultural attitude which encourages xenophobia, for it encourages fear of globalisation, which prompts many local communities to become inward-looking and refuse dialogue, dialogue which takes identity into account.
I will end, Mr President, by hoping that the content and pace of my speech have been as you requested, that is, on a human scale.
On the matter of transparency, I would urge the Commission, in particular, to throw its weight behind Amendments Nos 9 to 11.
He is right in claiming that a distinction must be drawn between this regulation and the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between Europe and South Africa.
We must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk.
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.



The original report was a natural extension of previous EU legislation, but if the amendments are adopted it will mean enormous financial losses for European companies that have taken investment decisions on the basis of EU acts.


They are ambitious directives and in some cases it means the Member States need to review fully their agricultural practices.

When it takes twelve years to conclude an agreement, it is because the agreement is far from easy to conclude.
It looks very much like this serious problem has been shelved, as a result of which, in our opinion, the arguments used to support the long transitional periods do not so much signify powerlessness as unwillingness.
However, the conditions under which this initiative was put forward tend more to reflect contempt for the life of the citizens and give us cause for serious concern about what will happen next.

In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support.
This makes it easier to understand why the European Union is not troubled by the barbaric invasion and continued occupation of 38% of Cyprus and by Turkey' s bombing raids in Iraq.


The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.
The road-rail discussion is a more difficult and also a more interesting one. We think the experiment being proposed here is most interesting.


It is long overdue, for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined.
Mr President, on a point of order.

cant you change to a console? maybe with some more input would help

Eventually, Commissioner Schreyer proposed EUR 850 million, or 121 million annually, 5 million less to invest in the fight against poverty which we deem so important.




I hope for the European Parliament's support and backing in our further attempts to improve the implementation of our European Community environmental legislation.
I warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen.
The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions.

Fourthly, we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the European Parliament since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force.


But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.
EPLP Members fully support the main direction of the Maaten Report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco.
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.

In the end the time was not wasted in exchanging pleasantries.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.
It is an indication of that old truth that being more transparent invariably means being more successful.

In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.
We regret that the joint resolution did not take up our suggestion to make the new reconstruction programmes conditional upon an undertaking by the governments of the former Yugoslavia to cooperate actively in the fight against organised crime.
Thanks are also due to all our fellow Members of Parliament, particularly Mrs Terrón, Mrs McNally and Mr Sami Naïr who are working on this issue.


So these are the indications we must seek and we should deal with them in a fully open and transparent manner.

However, I would still like to comment on a couple of points.
Commissioner, I speak to you not as a neutral referee but as a representative of the executive institution of the European Union.
In my country, there are indications that the price of industrial sites is rising considerably thanks to European aid.

This is good, because in this way we can start restoring confidence in the producer, especially at a time when food safety is so much in the public eye.


Simira: it's not detected by gthumb?
However, I would like to insist on certain points.

It is just not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the others because of pressure from industry.
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.

That would give them the best sort of assistance in the months and years ahead.
I shall sum this up in one sentence: work on the Constitution and therefore on Europe' s prospects must be clearly launched during the French Presidency.


The present joint resolution supports the persecuted and the journalists in Iran who are doomed to unemployment.


Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.
if it's used




The report is therefore well-worked and makes a solid contribution to the understanding of the policy of charging for infrastructures as well as its application, a key issue in the orientation of transport policy and in making progress with a policy which guarantees lasting transport and mobility for the future and in dealing in a rational way with the extraordinary demand to which we are going to have to find a solution in the years to come.

As I stand before this House, which represents the people of Europe, I am bound to say that we need to remember our starting point and the fundamental cause underlying today' s debate.
However, I believe that the Commission has a responsibility to put forward more balanced views which do not undermine the value and success of an industry which has made an enormous contribution, not only to the countries of the European Union but worldwide.

The third possibility is to hold debates on Fridays without voting and then delay the votes until Brussels or subsequent sittings.


The area in question, which is constantly developing, is in need of detailed rules, but they must not be too rigid or they will rapidly become obsolete.

Thus, as regards the idea of the creation of a commission for stock exchange operations, I recommend a green paper on the establishment or gradual creation of such a commission, preceded by a feasibility study.




I know that the Commission is endeavouring to take account in the budget of the priorities it has accepted, namely creating a knowledge-based society and improving the quality of life of our citizens.

This warning should give us food for thought.


That must not, of course, prevent us from paying attention to the problems that exist.
We do not share the presumption that a comprehensive charter can be drafted which comprises all current fundamental rights.
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.
Mr President, I asked to speak in this debate not just because I am a Member from the north-west region of England where the Sellafield plant is situated, not just because there could be 10 000 livelihoods at risk if Sellafield was closed, and not because I have any vested interest in the nuclear industry.







Mr Alavanos, there is no contradiction in this respect and the problem is very simple. As this issue is not covered by a Community provision, it is solely a question of Greek national policy and is subject to Greek law.
ouch, thats happened to me in hoary too



It is based on the principle of a global approach which takes account of the whole life cycle of the product.

On balance, the rules for promoting the development of the countryside are extremely flexible but, according to the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to the Member States to implement them.
10) Respect for neutral States' solutions in the field of defence policy and for their right to make their own decisions should be clearly upheld within the framework of the CFSP (paragraph 34).
The recent Camp David summit was held in response to this situation and, even though it did not achieve the hoped-for agreement, it did open new prospects on all aspects of Permanent Status and, as such, cannot be considered a failure. On the contrary, it created new momentum.
I would like to see a report in which the role of our Palestinian counterpart is explained.
For example, the road transport monopoly springs to mind, with the impact this has on the levels at which short sea shipping should pitch its prices to tie in with Bilbao' s short sea port.
Concerning night flights, these will be discussed in a moment.
The insurance company asked me my age, and when I replied that I was 80 years old, they said 'You are worthless, you count for nothing, and so we are not going to give you any compensation.' "

I hope that we will be able to keep the dialogue going with the government, the opposition and the civil society.


I tabled a question to the Commission in October on the environmental hazards posed by DU, depleted uranium 238, shells in the Balkans and suggested that some of the emergency aid package to Serbia should be dedicated to investigating and, if proven, making good the toxic and radioactive damage possibly posed to the people of Kosovo.
Unfortunately, this seems to apply not only to the public, but also to business.


The people are keen to hear that there was great unity here in the European Parliament, how this came about, and what the outcome of our debate was.
We feel that China will, in the long term, see the obvious need for the rapid economic and social development of China to be fostered within a framework of open markets and democratic reform.
As we know, there is an old saying, prevention is better than cure.
This is no longer the case. That is why many of us welcomed the speech made by the President of the French Republic to the Reichstag, particularly his decision to declare the European Constitution to be the key to all future mechanisms for change.
My main objective in drafting this statement was to warn against carrying matters to excess, and the unforeseeable consequences thereof, but without wishing to compromise the principle of family unity.
Apart from the fact that the Turkish army has occupied 37% of Cypriot territory for 26 consecutive years, Turkey - a candidate for EU membership - disputes the island's status as an independent state on an almost daily basis.


But how to do it - this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job.
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.

It was the first discharge after the fall of the Santer Commission and thus the first opportunity for this Parliament to have a say in the European Commission' s reform policy.
This is something which I - which we - wish to see, but we are not going to give that indication.
Secondly, we witnessed major changes in Europe in 1989-90, not to mention before and since then.


You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.



The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.

The application and control of Community legislation is also important. The Member States must cooperate in this application.
The next item is the report (A5-0136/2000) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (COM(1999) 566 - C5­0067/2000 - 1999/0253(CNS)).
The statistics of the epidemic are frightening and still getting worse.




It is fundamental to a democracy that the executive should serve the electorate and the electorate' s representatives.

We do not seem to manage, once the police and courts are involved, to rise above the nationalistic knee-jerk reaction.


On the specific case mentioned, what is happening is as follows. The fact that Belgian fishermen will not be fishing in the Irish Sea does not stem from any Council decision as the regulation approved by Council provides for fishing quotas to be granted to Belgium in these waters.
In addition, there is a need for more specific action aimed at changing people' s mentality.
The same lack of resources and staffing is continually remarked upon - other speakers have raised it on other points - even despite the frequent comments by the Court of Auditors on the subject.
Not only does that undermine their economic development, not only does that significantly reduce their ability to provide basic social services, such as health or education, but it creates a sort of slavery which benefits Western societies.

There are five questions I would like to ask you.

Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Daul and Mrs Lulling that, in debates on the Rules of Procedure, you must always bear in mind that there are also tactical and strategic aims coming into play.
The European Parliament must express a political opinion; it must speak from the heart and not on the basis of figures; it must listen to its soul instead of numbers.

This would mean that, in many Member States, important political powers would not be represented at EU level.
Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic.

I might also mention Europe' s duty to comply with international provisions and to support the development of the production of vegetable proteins to replace meat and bone meal in animal feed.

The problem with the Internet is that the pictures are so clear.
As long as the result - caring for the protected species and their habitats - remains paramount.

They have no say as regards its content.
I live in an area of Europe where, every day, every week, the dead bodies of emigrants from the north and south of Africa appear. These victims do not appear in the news because, fortunately, they are yet to die on a massive scale, but rather they die in a trickle.
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.

or do we need to?
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.

It is also one of the most important tasks for the European Union in the coming years.
In addition to the 'product quality and taste' aspect there is, of course, the 'development policy' aspect. The ACP countries fear losses of income in the region of 160 million dollars if our large industrial chocolate producers use up to 5% of other vegetable fats, with this percentage being the recommended figure but not actually being verifiable.
It will, if necessary in the light of this evaluation, submit a proposal to amend this directive by the introduction of a system involving the payment of an appropriate percentage, of no less than one third of the costs of port reception facilities, by all ships calling at a port of a Member State irrespective of actual use of the facilities.
In so doing, they would also do Europe what I think is a currently much needed service.
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on. But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.


The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.

derJunior: dunno if galeon is in hoary, limewire depends on ava i think...
In effect, if the content of the directive is being changed, this is due to the pressure of the five multinationals - Nestlé, Suchard, Mars, Cadbury and Ferrero - which already share over 70% of the European market but whose production capacity is hindered by the current dual legislation.

I am convinced that one day, we will be proud again of a label which states: produced in the EU, and that we will have a food safety bureau in the European Union with a forceful, supranational mandate which can act promptly as and when problems arise.
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.

In parallel with the work on these practical aspects, a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States. This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
And yet the facts do not look very promising.


We need to very careful about that.
In Germany, for example, work is being lost due to illegal employment and, for every ten thousand jobs, DM 240 million is lost in taxes and social security contributions.
Secondly, would the Council be prepared, in this whole process, to suspend or cancel obligations of the European Union relating to the pre-accession process as long as the people we are talking about remain in prison?

Consumer choice will be exercised regardless of what the EU does, and that is only fair.

Mr President, what we have just seen is an attempt to wreck the Thursday sitting just as Friday's sitting as been done away with, partly by undermining these topical and urgent debates.

Mr President, Environment Commissioner, I am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away.

(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
What is more, the instrument as such is being weakened.
We are unhappy with this, firstly because Parliament, as has already been pointed out, is seeing its rights diminished, specifically its right to remain informed.
It is a critical time too, as I was saying, because of the transition in the United States. Bill Clinton is no longer in office.
I very much hope that, without breaking down some important distinctions, we can ensure that the Community's various instruments, which involve the expenditure of quite substantial amounts of assistance, are moving together in the same direction.


We should therefore have already set in motion the TEN projects that have still to get off the ground.


Mr President, we are great talkers about human rights in the EU, but in practice it is often the case that citizens' rights are synonymous with money.

The Commission wrote to Ministers for Agriculture on 4 January and asked for replies to an extensive questionnaire on the implementation of BSE-related measures.
However, it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability.

- (PT) Mr President, I would firstly like to explain why I voted the way I did: I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution because I agree with the serious concerns and actions it puts forward, although this does not represent a change in my Group' s position. Our position is that we have concerns about the Union' s courts having responsibility for forestry policy.
As I speak, the lid is being lifted on the infamous Dutroux case in the form of an excellent investigation on the Belgian national television station, RTBF. Unfortunately, I was not able to see the whole thing.

Mr Bautista Ojeda, your comments will be recorded in the Minutes and will be passed on to the Bureau.

This poverty focus is essential in order to actually get value for money.



I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.
But it is an extremely critical situation.
Mr President, these are but a few examples, but they do demonstrate that the European Parliament can yield substantial results if it makes a concerted effort.


However, it is difficult to grant discharge for a budget which is two years old and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that it was not the responsibility of the present Commission but of its predecessor, a Commission which resigned because it failed to take its responsibilities seriously enough.
Thank you very much, Mr Morillon, we will pass on that request.

The whole is better than the sum of its two parts.
This is why we wanted, and secured, the stipulation, first of all, that if the directive were not approved by the Members of the European Parliament, the Member States would draw up rules guaranteeing good groundwater status.

His crime, according to the Burmese authorities, was to enter the country and attempt to draw attention to the human rights abuses taking place there.

I think that first we must seek out all renewable energies and take advantage of them, encourage them, promote them and provide the appropriate incentives to make them viable, and at the same time penalise energies that contaminate.




The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?
This solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research, a point stressed by the European Parliament, but it nevertheless falls short of what is required.
Therefore, there is no room for a solution based on exclusive claims.
Moreover, I fully endorse the idea of a common transatlantic air space, provided that this is not subject to unilateral European concessions.
Above all, they give the countries of this crisis-riven region an important political signal and a definite incentive.

Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.

Over time, all of this is resulting in a postponement of the decision on the non-obligatory expenses incurred by the Council, and this decision and postponement were not provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!

These friction costs can be attributed first and foremost to the absence of coherent system networks and connections linking the latter, leading to a loss of efficiency and an increase in transfer costs.

The report we are debating deals with a series of points we fully agree with, aiming principally at guaranteeing the fundamental rights of the citizens of third countries who choose one of the Member States of the European Union as a place of work and residence.



Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single-handedly.
i use synaptic too

I therefore think that this policy calls for caution, Commissioner.
The 'therapeutic cloning' plan will be the spark that kindles the fire since no one can guarantee that limited and specific use will be made of cloning.

The main political aim at the first reading was to limit the scope for derogations from the prescribed limit values as far as possible, to make the rules as restrictive as possible, and I believe that we can be more than pleased with this solution, which was the fruit of our joint efforts.

We must clearly set firm objectives.

We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.

I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.

We then had the privilege of the Prime Minister of Portugal speaking.

I think this is an extremely dangerous demonstration, given that France is a country in which the fight against religious cults has had some very significant successes.

As for budgets, our main concern is where the money is coming from.

If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.

The Annual Report for 1999 covers the last year of the first mandate of the European Ombudsman.

Macro-financial assistance is usually granted for periods of one year, it is not always renewed, it is granted in different areas, different countries, according to the circumstances and we believe, therefore, that the current system of concentrating its control in a particular body, the Economic and Financial Committee, makes sense since this is the group of people with the greatest experience and knowledge of the control and management of this type of aid.

The European Parliament will play an important part in this.

Finally, I should like to ask whether the Commissioner would be prepared to discuss possible scenarios for commitment at some point in the future, for we are now theorising about instruments, but we must also talk about the practical implications at some stage, and for this purpose, a scenario discussion would, I believe, be very desirable.

We are not trying to tell anyone what to do, but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs Malmström said - is not just about creating wealth at home. There are many of us in this House who believe we must go on building Europe to promote and uphold its fundamental values, in the spirit of the founding fathers.


I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.
Such a policy is not merely hypocritical. It is aiding and abetting fire.

A great deal has been done, but still more needs to be done, especially when it comes to aligning different countries' legislation for the purposes of tracing and prosecution and when it comes to providing information to the police and courts.




Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.

It is easy to see that the European Union has every interest in the stabilisation of the region and that interest will grow with future enlargement.
The recommendation to create an observatory is one in fact that has been picked up in several EPP resolutions in recent months and I am therefore very surprised to see such a hostile resolution from that quarter here this week.


We gladly subscribe to those aspects of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report that could lead to us speaking with one voice.
Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again.

A good way of favouring diversity is to give particular support to the weaker elements.

For my part I am convinced that the approaching start of the next WTO cycle should mean we can handle this issue positively in a more global context and for that I am counting on the Commission' s determination.

What is of particular concern, however, is the information that we have received not only on the delay in the fishing agreements with Angola, but also on the difficulties in renewing the fishing agreement with Morocco.
But no one bothers to mention, for example, that consumer associations in my country have been wantonly campaigning for food at rock bottom prices for years now.
I have had to speak in too many debates like this dealing with the consequences of crises like this, in the Great Lakes, in Ethiopia, in the Sudan and now in Ethiopia again.
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.
We are to build upon firm ground when we talk of human rights, and we should therefore especially build upon those conventions to which the countries concerned have acceded and upon the legal practice which the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights has developed in such a distinguished way since the Second World War.
At the time the Commission had already made a proposal which on the whole was very good and which also received support in Parliament.
On the issue of labelling, I am sorry to see that there are amendments against this.
To sum up: overall, we are being very sparing with the European tax payer' s money in performing our role as part of the budgetary authority.
The European Union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand.
I will not bore you with the details.
In other words, in the whole process not an iota of money is created.

or the mplayer win codecs?

In the Alpine regions, for example, the institution of voluntary fire brigades is taken for granted.

Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.
This multilateral approach must also be mirrored in the fields of cultural and social cooperation.
Seven years after its creation, however, EMAS is a success only in some countries.

Our group is in favour of adopting the report with its amendments.

At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.

The European Union has vast experience and the resources necessary to set up, at very short notice, operations such as the monitoring of elections, border control, police force training and outfitting.
Mr President, Commissioner, education is assuming an ever more important role in the European strategy.
Mr President, could I begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question.
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.

That is the development of a true, single market; because if we were able to achieve a true, single market, not only might we find more unanimity within this Chamber, but we should be well on the way to serving our constituents by ensuring that we achieve real economic progress in Europe.
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.

It regards tourism for senior citizens.
If Europe has fallen into line with the principle of culling animals over 30 months, is that in itself enough?


B5-0065/2001 by Mr Cohn­Bendit and Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Turkish prisons;

Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to start by thanking the rapporteur both for the enormous amount of work he has done and also, in particular, for his willingness to accept the suggestions, amendments and proposals of all the rest of the committee, to the point that I feel this report can be said to be a highly collegial report produced by the committee as a whole.



The French Presidency attaches special importance to ensuring that Council proceedings are accessible to the European citizens and that its legislative decisions are made in a transparent manner.

Given that the Union' s vacillating behaviour in the Balkans during the recently elapsed decade of the previous century is still fresh in the memory, this robust declaration sounds extremely implausible to my mind.

Visa requirements between Russia and Georgia

The centralisation, cross-checking, analysis and use of this data must be carried out by the existing Working Group.
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.

But it is also the responsibility of the governments to take measures to alleviate the difficulties and provide solutions for the sectors that are most affected.

At the time of the Uruguay Round, particularly when the mechanism for the settlement of disputes was being set in place, there was a institutional shift in the international legal order which justified assent, specifically with regard to an unequivocal reading of the Treaties.


The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.
We would surely want to uphold the spirit, the ideals, and the values which formed the foundation of our European unity.
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.


This is my first point regarding the policy.
I will submit a more detailed description of the incident shortly, but, for the time being, I would be very grateful if you could make the German authorities aware of the problem. Border police need to be aware of the existence and function of this document.
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.


yes, and bleeding edge

One positive point is that small and medium-sized enterprises have been identified as a very important target group, as this group is one where there could be considerable problems at the changeover stage.
As for the other problems, we can talk about these.

Mr President, I voted for this report on the common fisheries policy, but I call upon the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to monitor more effectively one of the factors referred to in paragraph 20 of the report, which is disregarded, namely how and whether the size of the pensions and situation of the pensioners in the fisheries sector and, in particular, in the small-scale fishing sector, are monitored.

We are all convinced that the future of the Union's Mediterranean strategy depends largely on the success of the Middle East peace policy, which we must be more zealous in supporting even though it is the United States which is at the forefront of this political initiative.


I should like briefly to illustrate this by way of three examples.

In fact, if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor, then it seems that the middle-range regions, covered by Objective 2, are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their GNP, and a worsening of the employment situation.


However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.

If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.
However, we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live.
There is an element of hypocrisy here, because half the House voted against having stronger measures on tobacco advertising and - I choose my words carefully - there are many Members in this House who are regular users, to different degrees, of alcohol, which is a very powerful drug.
It has to be redistributed time and again.

This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.


I emphasise this point not because I am any particular fan of sanctions, but if there is one country that does deserve them, it is Burma.


What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses.


We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.
The material basis of this system consists of a division of labour according to gender which, at all levels of the hierarchies, assigns to women the tasks which are either unpaid or more poorly paid.

B5­0635/2000 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian representative on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;

Furthermore, the Commission has promised to pull up its socks by carrying out fewer tasks.
That is not rhetoric, because it is taking the fight to the very area in which the battle must be won.


When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.
However, that it is not the way to reach the public, nor is it efficient.
In a world of hypocrites and careerists, Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments.

I got a very rude answer from them which I will not repeat to you but which is basically reflected in my report.

Whichever of the two institutional trends implicitly reflected in the debate about the Charter we look at, these groups can take entirely sovereign economic decisions that spell disaster for an entire population, leading, for example, to factories closing down and to the ruin or pollution of an entire region.


You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.
That can be subject to derogation but again only after attempts to broker collective agreements to involve the social partners.


More specifically, the Commission wishes to point out that a very short deadline has been set for the Council to adopt the necessary legislative measures to be able to prosecute and punish the behaviour of those who profit from trafficking in human beings.
That is not easy, but the present system is untenable.
With reference to the conditions making aid conditional on accession to and compliance with the Treaty of Ottawa, what criteria and procedures will be used for the implementation of EU actions to ensure that, in the field, some vulnerable communities are not victimised twice?
On behalf of my Group, I shall, as I said, support an extension to the arrangements, but I would strongly urge the Commission, before 2002-2003, to make a concerted effort to investigate possible changes to the way in which we employ resources so that we can, in the future too, safeguard that group of farmers which, until now, has been supported by means of the aid arrangements in question.
2005-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	scoon	anyway
However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so.
Quite different is the case of Morocco, or even Albania or Sri Lanka, where there is a greater likelihood of multi-sectoral cooperation, and there are countries with privileged situations such as Morocco, where we have just implemented an association agreement.
Firstly, the point must be made quite forcefully that the existence of organised criminal networks, as well as the scale of professional smuggling, which is contemptible but lucrative, plays a central role in illegal immigration, both in increasing the flows themselves and in the methods for smuggling people, of which the tragedy at Dover is an extreme example.


I also share the view of Mr Prodi and the Commission that in a number of areas, there is a need for more Europe and more integration, and rightly so.
In November of last year, representatives of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Kosovo.

Mr O'Toole is right in saying that simulcasts would not make it possible to attract a group of substantial users and he therefore believes that a trial period for new audiovisual products on channels made available through digital transmission, possibly only over sections of territory, will enable operators and users to achieve the same objective.

Mr President, I should like to take advantage of the question by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines to touch on an aspect of tertiary education in candidate countries which affects young people not from these countries but from other Member States of the European Union, such as Greece, who attend universities in candidate countries in large numbers.
However, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either.
I do not agree with this. This is taking it much too far.
In addition to the Schengen acquis, practical measures of the same type are also being taken on behalf of the European Union. These are generally based on the Community acquis and particularly on the common position of 25 October 1996 which established the assistance and information missions carried out away from the border.

As long as those market distorting subsidies to fossil fuels continue we cannot realistically talk about a fair or level playing field in the European Union.

I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question, although I have always been, and still am, a non-smoker: does the Commission not think that if tobacco cultivation were to be completely discontinued within the European Union with immediate effect - as called for by a fair number of people - people would just carry on smoking regardless because tobacco products would be imported into the EU?


Mr President, I just want to say that, after 11 years as an MEP, I am familiar with the French airline concerned. For that reason, I chose another and arrived on time.



We must prevent divisions, divisions between the regions of Europe, between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe.
This leads to a breakdown in any fragile solidarity and further damage to their self-image. Mrs Roure is right in her analysis of this problem but we accept that different solutions must be examined and that various proposals must be made and considered.
I am not going to insist on 30 seconds, but I would ask you only to ask questions that are essential.

Within the European Union, we have achieved a certain amount of success when it comes to improving air quality.
Mr President, whichever way we view the Balkans, in the light of recent atrocities or future events in terms of the Stability Pact, we always seem to come up against this horrifying character of Milosevic and his cronies, people who have a string of crimes against humanity to answer for and who should urgently be taken to the Court of Justice in The Hague.
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.








There are Europeans on the other side of the Mediterranean and we would do well to remember that.
However, the next speaker will probably know more about this than I do.


Any such discussion should of course begin with the Treaty.
2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	LostMonk	should i get that and a few other things before i convert?
Consequently, in this case my group was more on the side of the Council than the majority of this Parliament.
Serious studies have concluded that the majority of serious accidents or deaths amongst these groups result from impacts with crash barriers, that is to say, against roadside protective barriers or against vertical road signs, both of which are designed and created for four-wheeled vehicles.
We also need new qualifications, as we know that access to technology does not necessarily guarantee high-quality jobs and entrepreneurial initiative. We need a greater sense of responsibility and greater participation from our social partners - new actors, as the Pintassilgo report calls them - so that we can implement employment agreements and achieve competitiveness in business.



I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.

On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.


We are represented in accordance with the subject matter!
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.

I ask Members to be aware of this and to bear it in mind when we vote.

This framework agreement is based on the principles of parliamentarism, democracy and transparency.
The fifth framework-programme, which was adopted using the codecision procedure, respects fundamental ethical principles and is based on the opinion issued by the European Ethics Group prior to the adoption of the framework-programme.
I should like a reply on this and I should like the Minutes to be corrected.
Why must the 14 Member States change?


Scotland, Wales, the Basque country, Catalonia, Galicia, even a region as large as Andalusia, cannot depend on the decisions of a central State, however much of a State it is.



It will need to take into consideration the findings of the evaluation exercise and, of course, before presenting it to the legislative authority, we in the Commission will have to ensure that we are able to mobilise the necessary human resources for its effective implementation.
Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur.
A long journey is a long way to go.

It has been said a million times and it will be said again, but today I am speaking from the heart and I feel Africa' s pain as if it were my own.
After that it becomes valid throughout the Community and then there is a court to sit on litigation, but up to the granting of the patent itself the European Patent Office will continue to work as it does now.


The Member States should take the initiative here and act in compliance with the EU format in their own administrative area.

I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.


We must demand that Eritrea and Ethiopia freeze their military activities so that all the assets, all the logistical and human capabilities of these countries are put at the service of their peoples.
What a decidedly strange Europe it is that penalises Member States which take the necessary initiatives and action to restore consumer confidence and protect citizens' health!




This requires ongoing monitoring and we very much welcome the revision of the series of directives which are the subject of this debate this evening.
We shall then be able to withdraw our proposal under item I.
Mr President, my report does indeed concern the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Finnish Presidency on the relations and obligations as between the Member States for the readmission of third country nationals inside the European Union.
We are talking about harmonisation, the harmonisation of tastes, of habits and, almost, of cultures.

Screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process.
I would like to test him, if I may, on Tibet because Tibet has now been illegally occupied by China for many years.
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.

From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.


Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?

We are talking about one of the most important branches of industry here, both within the EU and beyond its borders.

It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.

The EU budget, however, is largely administered within the Member States, and this is where huge potential for fraud exists.
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.
Although these costs form a substantial part of the total costs incurred, it is wrong to suppose that this means the total costs are known.
thanks all
or should it just work
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.


As I said, it has been a long, drawn-out business and the last time we discussed it in Parliament was December 1999.
It must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency.


Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.

However, there are three fronts to which Parliament needs to pay more attention between now and September.


Furthermore, Mr President, that committee worked alone, with no transparency, with no interministerial consultations and without consulting the interested parties.


However, one has the impression that anti-European forces within the army and the administration are behind the recent arrests and the new offensive against the PKK in northern Iraq in order to prevent Turkey from moving closer to Europe.

I believe that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is due to speak after me; that means that all of us who have basically concentrated on little else in our work over the last six years except BSE are back again.

Italy has the Red Brigades and Spain has ETA.

The draft Directive' s proposal concerning the right to family reunification after one year would not be any problem if, in common with other countries, Denmark were to make such demands, as expressly laid down in the draft directive.
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.
On this issue, it is quite clear, as Mr Liese surely knows, as it is clearly stated in the fifth framework-programme, since it is subject to a codecision procedure, that research involving cloning techniques for reproductive and therapeutic purposes are quite explicitly excluded.



So there are no grounds for putting words into the mouths of the Members of the European Parliament present in New York on mere intent.


Equality is not a women' s issue and can only be achieved through cooperation between both sexes.


Even though the joint motion for a resolution is an interesting one, it does not tackle the subject of flags of convenience, a problem which must be both condemned and resolved as a matter of urgency if we are to contribute to the principle of preventing maritime disasters.


Transport costs should be paid by the user, but governments should not charge rural users if there is no public transport, and this report makes that very clear.

We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.

I therefore call on the Commission to take every opportunity, in all its talks with representatives of the Serbian Government or embassies, to present the list of prisoners and to request information on each prisoner.
For example, troikas of heads of mission have been sent on fact-finding missions to Tibet. This issue is also regularly raised in the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China.

The sooner the court can sit, the better for everyone.
I should like to thank him, nonetheless, for having tried to accept Amendments Nos 1 to 8, which constitute the bulk of the Committee on Industry' s amendments, which complement the rapporteur' s report.
I also have a longer version of the declaration if the President would like to see it.
Once I had immersed myself more deeply in the subject, I was amazed to learn what this was all about.
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.
The rapporteur does not even mention the invasions of personal privacy or violations of data protection rights that are part of daily life for asylum-seekers.

rolfzor: yeah, you have to know what you are doing. besides, some people consider xp contacting time.microsoft.com a proof for spyware in xp.
I can tell you on behalf of our group that you also have our full support in relation to the substance of your statement, in which you give priority to a European Community approach, rather than to intergovernmental cooperation, the cooperation between governments that we firmly reject in the Community framework.
I thank the rapporteur for his patience, his skill and, above all, his commitment to the cause of Europe's railways.
The importance of the latter cannot be emphasised enough.
That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue, maybe, of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel.

Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.
Following an opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment confirming such risks, the Commission proposed in December of last year a directive restricting marketing and use of certain azocolourants which could pose a risk of cancer if they come into close contact with the skin.

We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities.

I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.

In particular, we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market, importing 60% of consumption, with the need to protect our fishermen, who see the Japanese, American and Korean markets closing.

Do not forget the Serbian people who have stayed behind in Kosovo.


As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.

It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.


Turkey has signed international agreements on human rights but, as has become bitterly apparent to journalists, writers, human rights activists and opposition politicians, these are not observed.
actually, I preferred XFCE
Another aspect that has not really been addressed is this: perhaps we could look into the conditions for creating new European, intermodal operators.

It seems to me that in this respect we should be as aggressive in our defence of the euro as our counterparts in the United States Congress are in defence of the dollar.
Properly applied this regulation will go a long way to enhance the reputation, quality and safety of EU beef - good news for consumers and producers!

What comments might the Council and the Commission have on France' s recent decision to remove commercial closed source code systems from its public computer systems, thus allowing open source code systems to be used, which is intended, as indicated by the French Defence Minister, to guarantee that no nation and no defence systems are at the mercy of a single person or a single company?
None of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are, nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue.
or he'll still be up playing bzflag...


It took me 12 hours to get to Strasbourg.
If they turn out to be insufficient, they will be supplemented with Commission initiatives.
Yet we certainly do not go along with the way Parliament is congratulating itself.

Therefore, an attempt was made during the complex negotiations between the Commission and the United States Department of Commerce to find a solution which would allow the transfer of data to those private companies which voluntarily submit to a self-regulation system known as the 'safe harbour' system.



If there were a breach of the environmental legislation, we could actually withhold project money.


That, to me, says that we need to look back at the whole framework of legislation we developed largely in the 1970s in this area - on transfers, collective redundancies, insolvency, and latterly on works councils.

I think this is a serious matter, because it is about patients having to suffer and about doctors being placed in impossible situations, from both moral and personal points of view.

As always when culture is involved, the budget is minimal, not to mention the fact that it is always gone ten in the evening by the time we get round to culture here.
That is a way of adapting and improving the Convention method, nothing more.
ogra, thanks

The Commission is responsible for transposition and for checking what sort of on-site controls have been carried out.



In our efforts to tackle the health and environmental situation in the Balkans, the Commission has established a twin-track approach.
I think we are at a turning point.



As the honourable Member knows, because a paper which the High Representative and I wrote for the European Council miraculously found its way into the newspapers, the question of better coordination of Member States' activities is one that both Javier Solana and I feel strongly about.
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.
I am aware that my answers are necessarily incomplete given the time available.

We are also concerned about this.
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.

Only through an addendum to Article 7.3, in which it is expressly stated that the Commission can propose further extensions in the light of the results of the 2004 review, was it possible for this agreement to come about.

As the law requires, consultations on those proposals will be undertaken with staff and with the other European Union institutions.

It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.
They are, however, important and they are consensual. We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner, and that is why, at the end of the day, we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner.
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.

- (FR) The report on which we are called to vote today is indicative of the position which the European Parliament wishes to adopt in the debate on maritime safety, brought to the fore once more by the tragic wreck of the Erika.

In studying the educational systems of the Member States of the European Union we should draw on a profound knowledge of the practices and acquired rights in our various countries, because each of our countries has its own educational reality.
The second Europe is one of countries that are negotiating with the European Union: countries, therefore, that are in the first or second-class waiting rooms for the European train.
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.


Their number has decreased by 500 000 in the last 15 years.


But I wanted to highlight that point so that the various language versions can be corrected.

Mrs Berès, Mr Jonckheer, Mr Crowley, Mr Skinner and Mrs Maes remarked that it might be possible to exclude broadcasting.
It is essential that, in Member States and in any cooperation between them, the basic principles of human dignity regain a central place, and are promoted and defended by policies to protect victims and prosecute those responsible.





At the same time as declaring he was in favour of transparency and openness in relation to this issue, he admitted that he only began to take action on it when it became a public issue about a week ago, despite his role as Secretary-General of NATO during the Balkans War.



Mr President, like most of the other speakers here, I see absolutely no reason at all for any kind of immediate suspension, or urgent suspension, of the hushkit regulations.




I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.
atropus: kill whatever is making it busy


I am counting on you all, if only for the benefit of the public that attends our debates.

Subject: EU action to combat mines Will the wide range of action programmes to combat mines have to be financed solely from budget line B7-661, which is now more justified than ever?


Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.

Mr Bonde is asking for the vote to be postponed.


As far as principles are concerned, this is a violation of the right to the freedom of movement and, from a more human point of view, it creates an often devastating situation for students who have sought to better their qualifications but then cannot find a relevant job at the end of it.
In that article it is implicit that redeemability will happen at par value unless there are any reasonable charges which would be deducted from the par value.
The ambitions are fine, but we want facts and we expect to see them at the end of the French Presidency.


We shall now suspend the sitting.




If we do nothing, the countries will remain trapped in a downward spiral.


In the case of Greece, debt stands at more than 100% of GDP, practically the same as in Belgium or Italy.

Working towards good governance and working towards strengthening democratic structures and political participation are vital factors in creating free societies which provide for better management of internal resources and more appropriate management of wealth distribution and, in particular, which do not encourage corruption and the siphoning-off of funds.


It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area.

However, the very fact that a serious breach of human rights in a United Nations member state should be mentioned at Geneva is really a political fact in itself.

There is fraud at every level of government at which I have served - local, national and European and regional.


Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.
What is your opinion on that?
Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated?
We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium, and the stadium in Brussels has been cited.

These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.


So that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind.

I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.
ogra, I just like that if I can see on the lists that a new gnome-panel has been released, I can copy gnome-panel-1.1 to gnome-panel-1.2 and install it (presuming nothing radically has changed)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the awful disaster caused by Hurricane Mitch sets three main challenges for European policy.

First of all Mr Harbour' s questions, which typically were perceptive and constructive, related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved.




Telecommunications traffic has demonstrated that, the electricity sector and numerous other sectors besides have demonstrated that.
The objective is to establish an information system providing for real-time transport management, as well as the use of electronic transactions in transport, by means of the development of real-time electronic information and transaction systems, the harmonisation of transport message, procedure and document standards using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems, a uniform liability regime designed to offer the end user a clear set of transparent conditions and procedures with regard to liability for cargos which may be damaged or lost during transportation, the development of information society technologies of benefit to intermodal transport, through the creation of an open structure which makes it possible to follow the movement of goods along the entire intermodal chain, and paperless transport, involving the harmonisation of document regulations and the creation of a single electronic window.

Contrary to some previous speakers, I think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the Kyoto protocol.



Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right.
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.

Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.
I have only given you a rough indication, and a personal opinion at that.


Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.


Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.
There is a lot to be said for an all­embracing approach to such issues of legal assistance and improved cooperation within the judicial field that is not limited just to environmental law.
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].
Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better.


Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences. This leaves it wide open to abuse.
and it did add restricted to sources.list
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.


This is completely unacceptable, and that is precisely how I see it.

The rapporteur has explained the main initiatives contained in his report: the creation of a common diplomatic college, the establishment of procedures for Commission delegates to be received in third countries - an initiative which Mr Patten has accepted in general terms and which I am pleased to see included in this report - and also the drawing up of an annual report on the activity of European Union delegates.
Let us hope that we can see the same happening in Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast and Togo in the forthcoming elections.

The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.
As for methods, I think they can be improved.

The Union must also guarantee these countries access to the markets for their products, which must be assessed from both an ecological and a social point of view, because there is little point in giving out aid, on the one hand, and excluding these countries from our markets, on the other.
Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive.





We have therefore tabled a motion to reject the Council' s common position.


It sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law.
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.
This new method of coordination will create a networked Europe, which organises interaction between the various seats of power, i.e. the national Ministries of Education, rather than a centralised Europe.

is fun
The committee also wants to reiterate its support for continued financial assistance to NGO participation in much of the technical committee work of the Parliament and the Commission.
Does one have to be modern to have the support of a few well-meaning broadsheets?

However, the question stressed the fact that this is a problem which has recently become more serious, precisely because of the ease with which our borders can be crossed. This movement of people basically originates in the candidate countries of the East.


When I talk about words, I am thinking about words like "bench-marking" and "peer review" .
The trans-Atlantic dialogue will focus on three foreign policy issues: the Balkans, Russia and the peace process in the Middle East.
This cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available.
trombie, arn't they the same as the newest ones?
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.
It is unreasonable, however, that the Commission (which is to be supervised) should be involved in deciding which information is to be made available.
On the other hand, particularly in its urgent resolutions, the European Union does not hold back in expressing stringent positions on the conduct of other countries or events taking place in other parts of the world where human rights are violated.
The pollutants emitted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste.
They are bringing forward far too much legislation and, with legislation, quality is usually in inverse proportion to quantity.
We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution.


So it is only natural that we should have opted for an initiative designed to promote culture, an initiative which takes increasing account of the role of books as indispensable carriers of our cultural heritage.
The substance of the Treaty must be implemented.
Commissioner, thank you for your response, but I must admit I find it hard to grasp the logic of it.
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.
I do think the services of this House should work more carefully on such key questions and it really is intolerable that despite my criticism yesterday the Minutes have got the text wrong again!

The Commission attended the 13th International Aids Conference, which took place in Durban, South Africa, from 7 to14 July 2000.
The guidelines lay particular emphasis on the quality and sustainability of public finances and the need to continue reforming Europe's product, capital and labour markets.
I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal.
The outcome of the negotiations is nowhere near the agreed percentage, which is regrettable.
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.





The sensitivity and complexity of the matter might explain why we are confronted with a total number of 52 amendments at second reading.
Mr President, I voted for the Wieland report because there needs to be an increase in professional requirements in the European Union.

This is not as much of a crisis as the 1970s.



It is worth emphasising, however, that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment.

Mr President, I shall not have the last word; that is the Commissioner's prerogative.

My report, Mr President, on the one hand reflects the critical feeling of all the groups with regard to aspects of form and substance in the presentation and preparation of the plans.

(soft mode)
How would their situation be improved by giving money to Brussels, only to have Brussels immediately give it back to them?
The procedures for granting legal refugee status and the conditions for assessing applications must therefore be harmonised so that these are equivalent in terms of the level of protection of asylum-seekers.
As to compensation, apart from the cases where the debtor is not responsible for the delay, the creditor is entitled as a result of this agreement to claim reasonable compensation from the debtor for all recovery costs incurred.

You have just expressed your view to the effect that you prefer to have the vote today.
Even though all spirits are ostensibly the same, there are cases where tariff items are not the same.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted with the Council' s common position.

When it comes to the continued ban on sales of snuff to other EU countries, we Swedish Christian Democrats consider that account should be taken of the unwillingness of these countries to introduce a new product they consider to be habit-forming and destructive from a public health point of view.
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.




And, of course, three Turkish soldiers also died.
How does the Commission propose in future to amend the basis for the allocation of structural fund aid so that large-scale tobacco growing can be halted in the EU?
It is, of course, a supplementary instrument to the others at the disposal of the Commission.

This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.

These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other. They reason that as long as they are flexible enough, they will get a lot of freight traffic.

The proposals and policies for electronic commerce and the measures being promoted to support it are coloured by the totally one-dimensional perception of profit and competitiveness.


In view of the nine million cars withdrawn from circulation every year and the 45 million litres or so of waste oil, I think something needed to be done about this issue.
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.

As in the case of the structural funds, the citizens will be led to believe that Europe is handing out heaven-sent money in order to assist them in managing refugees.
The 11th Annual Report should, therefore, at the same time include a progress report.
However, in addition to this aspect, China' s accession to the WTO will also have effects at political level, given that the requirements for internal reforms and greater transparency, and consequently greater exposure to external public opinion, will have an impact on the actions of the Chinese authorities in areas other than the strictly commercial area.
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.


oh ok

However, the European Union repeatedly has cause to regret - we have been seeing this recently - that it cannot meet the requirements of external action.
see let us come together to make ubuntu better..
I am in no doubt about this.
It is therefore unfortunate that the Blokland report is putting unrealistic solutions forward when it is known that a good many directives on waste management are not yet applied or are not properly applied by Member States.
Europe is like a huge seed, and its economic strength lies precisely in its tradition of operating in all sectors, both new and traditional, and excelling in the traditional sectors.
Mr President, the explosion in the prices of oil products illustrates the need to make the euro into a genuinely international currency.



so the passwd stuff is shadow now, not passwd?


The danger is too great for us to ignore.
We wish the French Presidency every success. I know that they are extremely concerned to resolve all difficulties and determined to achieve their objectives.
At international level I envisage this regulation to be an important tool for the Community to promote the conclusions of the UN intergovernmental forum on forests.

We must awaken citizens' consciences where our children are concerned.
Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem, including within the European Union.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.

(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.
Would the Commissioner be prepared to encourage observers from the Central and Eastern European countries that wish to join the EU, to attend management committees, scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health, on a permanent basis?

Having put this marker down for this time, in the future we would like to see the process reviewed so that it amounts to more than just ourselves as a Parliament swapping lists with the Commission.

Because sport had its roots in ancient Greek Olympia, sport had prophets such as de Coubertin, and sport allowed peoples to meet in peace.
So while the safe harbour principle may not be an ideal solution to this problem, it will at least impose a certain number of rules and will be a way of preventing abuse.



That is why I say they have to be linked.

This could not be further from the truth.
Parliament' s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding.
The issues which created the most problems were women' s rights to sex education, free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS.

From 1991 to 1997, UN inspectors - UNSCOM - systematically and comprehensively inspected, destroyed and verified Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction.

During the war in Yugoslavia, American aircraft continuously bombarded towns, killing civilians.
This is an issue which is now entirely without contention.
It is my intention to present this proposal for a directive in the autumn of 2000.




We now realise that in fact every job description needs to be regulated.


Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.
This is the attitude that I hope will prevail on the approach of European governments towards the Colombian Government on 30 April in Brussels.
The proposed directive and the amendment proposing to establish a standard charging scheme for vessels in ports, in all European ports, in order to finance the processing of shipboard waste, tackle the problem on two fronts: they force the ports to set up the facilities and the organisation to handle the shipboard operational waste, either under direct state control or by subcontracting to specialised competent operators, and, more importantly, they deter vessels from evading their obligation to dispose of waste since they will have to pay the price in any case.

As for the developing countries, I want to say that, if Britons, Scandinavians and others are not allowed to eat the chocolate they ate as children, they would certainly eat marshmallows or jelly babies instead on a Saturday evening.

This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.
Here we must avoid any risks.







The rapporteur also proposes setting target dates for achieving these objectives. This is essential.
In the last-named area, I particularly welcome the initiative of players in the health sector to offer 'exportable' services which take account of the specific circumstances of cross-border commuters.


It provides a kind of framework for internal policy which we need and renders a whole raft of discussions redundant.
Subject: Human rights of women in Europe On 19 January 2000, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe met to prepare a special session of the UN General Assembly due to take place on 5-9 June 2000 in New York to assess the situation of women five years on from the Beijing World Conference on Women, which adopted a platform for action to tackle the problems faced by women at international level.

With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC/1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible.
This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission.
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.




Let us also remember that this is no more and no less than a matter of establishing the right to family reunification and that we must stop seeing family reunification as a privilege.
Thank you very much, Mrs Eriksson.
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.
Mr President, I am not about to start arguing the toss with Mr Swoboda over where the Balkans begin.

Moreover, the aid under the TACIS programmes must concentrate more on vocational training, education and improving the totally outmoded transport, communications and energy infrastructure. Small crafts and services businesses can only be started up if there are prospects of improving the framework conditions for competition and investment, which is only feasible in the long term with the help of the European Union.

In its final report to the European Commission, the group of experts drew up an inventory and made recommendations.
It is certainly not the intention of the Commission or Commissioner Verheugen to interfere in this matter.

Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?
Inspection is on its way, at long last.
The average wage among State employees is MDL 230, which is to say approximately SEK 150 or about EUR 19.
As I mentioned earlier - and I was also speaking for my colleague Mr Vitorino - we see eye to eye on many of the concerns raised by a number of Members of this House this morning, but this is not an opportune moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the Monitoring Centre itself.
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.
You all know that the introduction of the compulsory labelling system had to be deferred last December because agreement could not be reached within the time frame available.
However, it is not enough simply to give them access to new communication and information technologies.

The protocol governing fishing arrangements between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea­Bissau was signed in June 1997 and came into force in December of that year, remaining valid until June this year.

I feel that it was both the work of the Presidency and the Commission and the involvement of all the female Members of this House who were there, and who joined with the national MPs of the Fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of Poland, which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work.

in terminal

Their leaders have had death threats, and death threats in Colombia are something to be taken very seriously, because they tend to be carried out.

Will the Council now make a statement on the issue?
The presidency will work in the Council to have the accession partnership for this country adopted and will continue to conduct a detailed analysis of the acquis.

Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.
We cannot resolve it simply through Interpol and more stringent criminal law.



It is not that we Socialists wish to see a policy of economic coordination against the central bank, but we do wish to see constructive dialogue between the decision makers in monetary policy and the decision makers in national economic policy, with each party, obviously, having to retain its own autonomy of action and decision making.
First and foremost, we need to remember that this is about people and based on this, we must develop a system which makes sound pension schemes possible, and we must, as far as we can, leave this task to the Member States.
I shall not repeat them, as our president, Doris Pack, has explained them better than we could.
Internet service providers have a role to play in this.

That is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first.
The Commission is on the right track. We should not, therefore, get distracted by restrictions upon the financial perspective as long as the net result is to be positive.
Furthermore, following a Commission decision in 1999, we consider that the issue has been largely resolved.


The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
One can only hope that it succeeds.
- (FR) It is not possible to ignore, today, the fortuitous coincidence of the second reading of this proposed directive against maritime pollution with the topical news of the tragic wreck of the Erika.
Or is this simply a way of dealing with public opinion, as the public is increasingly suspicious of the food chain? We cannot change public opinion overnight on the basis of this agricultural policy.
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.
And I should like to remind you...
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.

For this reason, paragraph 17 in this report is very important.

The second, which the presidency also mentioned, is how can this cycle of violence that we have witnessed over recent months be brought to an end?
We give so much money to the countries which border on the Mediterranean through programmes such as MEDA: we should request that they set up waste collection systems in their ports as well!


I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.
This Parliament should not be discussing safety during one particular Euro 2000 match under pressure from what I assume is a portion of British public opinion.



It is time that we learnt from our mistakes and adopted effective and appropriate measures, which can be complied with without trying to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

If the Council had any concern about budget control, we certainly would not be sitting in this building right now.
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this?
The Commission has also undertaken an in-depth review of its own organisation and procedures in the area of foreign policy, in order to adapt them to these new challenges.
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.

We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.
Finally, can you tell us what - if anything - the European Union is getting from the United States, as, according to statements by Mr Lamy, the negotiations undertaken with the Chinese have been based on what the Americans had already obtained, with increased benefit for the Europeans.
What use is the right of residence to me, if I do not have the right to exercise the profession I am trained in, in the host country?

In our view, this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market.

If resource levels are getting worse and worse, it is because a sequence of failures in the policy that governs fishing not only allows it to happen but actually causes it.
It is important to stress, however, in this connection, that it is up to the individual Member States to ensure compliance with the regulations of the common fisheries policy and the free movement of goods, and to take appropriate measures within their national legislative systems. The offences in question should be punished in accordance with the terms of the criminal and civil law of the Member State concerned.

We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training, evaluation and the appointment system.

I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.
There are 880 million illiterate adults, two-thirds of whom are girls and women.
The question is whether this long wait is desirable. I do not think so.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on a very timely and far-reaching communication which explicitly acknowledges the rapidly growing environmental impact of air transport and clearly recognises that this growth is unsustainable.
We have to do better and we can do better.

Seen in this light, it is time for all of us to call for constructive work to commence on our own Charter.
Secondly, what is intended in this White Paper - in which we shall have the opportunity to discuss all these issues in great depth, and in which problems of charging and the competitiveness of the various modes of transport, etc., will also appear - is precisely to make progress in sorting out bottlenecks, which does not mean that in some cases we shall not have to think about enhancing certain road infrastructures.

At a time when a wave of racism and xenophobia is forming across Europe and when consideration is being given to drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, you ought to reject Eurodac, with or without amendments.

I think that it makes more sense, given the worsening situation in Iraq, to hold a debate once the Council and Commission have made statements detailing their position rather than under the urgency procedure.
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.


However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments.

Animals have to have fat in their diet.
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.

It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds.
In the future, the International Criminal Court will send out a clear signal that perpetrators of any of these crimes will be prosecuted and punished.
In this respect, I would like to refer to the wonderful article by Mr Riccardi of two or three months ago, in which he spoke specifically of the fact that, for reasons of scale, the Mediterranean countries do not attract investment.
I should like to ask a follow-up question: What conditions are being laid down for in fact providing this aid?

Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.
It no doubt says something about the relationship between Parliament and the Commission at the moment that the text presented to us has been produced very urgently and is therefore very brief and very simple.And, as Mr Howitt also mentioned, is it, of course, not particularly satisfactory to receive it four or five months after the regulation has in fact expired, but this is actually the usual way, although I do not suspect Mr Patten of being up to no good.
pozac: no luck. it only gave me back the bottom panel. ther other one where the gnome stuff is (like system etc) is still away

This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.
But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa.

We requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a Parliament in the communication process with the United States within the WTO.

Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments.

I should like to emphasise that Portugal and President Guterres' entire team have deserved well of the European Union and that France now has the opportunity to prove that even a large country can complete a successful presidency.

Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.

I am informed by our services that the other reason for making this proposal was related to the limited time the groups have to table amendments.

Mr President, one of the European Union' s key goals was the creation of the internal market, but this market has created a volume of traffic which is growing at an alarming rate.
A fat lot of good that will do them.


I am rather disappointed that the report does not discuss these issues and somewhat surprised that the EPP has adopted this position given that, tomorrow, in another report on the Union' s political priorities, it will probably adopt a more forthright position on the communitisation of external policy.
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.
It must be seen in that context.
This will allow us to ensure ahead of time that the infrastructure in these countries can keep pace, thereby helping to minimise the separate costs which the European Union would otherwise incur.

The proposal of the Commission is that the executive powers, the implementing powers of the system, should be delegated to the Commission, associated with a committee composed of representatives from all Member States.

I should like to hope that Parliament' s insistence on certain points being adopted will also help the Turkish side to understand, even if - as Mr Morillon rightly comments - it appears to be somewhat unwilling to understand, that the road towards Europe is not a one-way street of determination and patient understanding on the part of the European Union in the face of Turkey' s so-called special circumstances; it requires the same measure of determination on the part of the Turkish authorities and Turkish society to adjust to the rules of law and ethics which govern the European Union and which apply indiscriminately to all candidate countries; rules which, unfortunately, continue to be violated by Turkey, not only when it comes to the Kurdish problem and its democratic shortcomings, but also in numerous other cases, such as the Cyprus question and Greek-Turkish relations.

I wish to state very clearly that, when talking about diversification of energy sources, sustainable energy has a clear and decisive contribution to make for the future, but at the moment we cannot ignore any type of energy.

The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted the draft report with a very small majority, plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary, show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC.
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.




The question was asked what will the ECB do if that creates problems for Denmark?
Considerable disadvantages could arise, on the other hand, within existing railway companies, for their staff and for the democratic decision-taking with regard to their future transport policy.
One of the young Serbian women told me that it is extraordinarily difficult for her to explain to her grandmother why she opposes Milosevic, as her grandmother only has her own information and experiences to go by.

Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.

If it is unthinkable and intolerable for public money to be used for irregularities and fraud, and if we must both dismantle the mechanisms enabling such abuses to take place and denounce the people involved, then we can also question the methods used to draw up this report.
According to my group, the EU has unique opportunities in this respect which, so far, have remained for the most part untapped.


I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.

Let us hope that it will, nevertheless, serve its purpose.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that this matter features on the agenda here today, for the International Criminal Court is doing well.

Mr Dell'Alba knows full well that, thanks to a clever buildings policy - let there be no mistake about that - we have been able to release considerable funds over recent years.
Let us look at the situation in Iraq.

The Commission has carefully examined the report by Mr Lehne, whom I would like to congratulate.

I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect.

But that would be another kettle of fish.
We welcome Sweden as an environmentally friendly presidency, but Sweden would be acting completely out of character if it were to send MOX fuel to Sellafield.

As was said earlier, we need a long-term strategy for Africa but also a Schuman-style plan for the joint management of those of Africa' s resources which are being fought over, for example in Sierra Leone or in the Congo, so that the struggle does not lead to conflicts with fundamentally undemocratic warlords.
4) 700 should not be set as the upper ceiling for the number of Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 3). Instead, a certain flexibility should be possible, depending upon the number of Member States in the EU.

Yet we must also remember that we managed to get nearly four million tonnes of food to sub-Saharan Africa thanks to action by the international community. This was partly in response to media coverage, which is playing an increasingly important role.

Personally, if I were not speaking as a Commissioner, I would consider Parliament' s figure far too low for the objectives we want to attain.
As for specific mechanisms to be established for the future system, there is also a split between those who defend a double-majority system and those who prefer simple reweighting.

Madam President, I should like to begin by associating myself, as the Prime Minister has just done, with your moving tribute to President Pflimlin.
If new tasks are to be adopted, then they need to be given staffing and administrative support.

By the end of the Portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries.

I think we must consider all matters related to renewable energies to be extremely important, bearing in mind the fact that we want to leave behind us a world which future generations will find inhabitable.
We must now continue, but I am sure that with the African agenda more rigorously defined in European policies, we are in a position to continue in a sustained and successful way, because the African continent requires it to be so. The situation of conflict, poverty and disease requires the European Union to boldly accept its responsibility.

With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.



This is nothing short of scandalous and must be overturned.
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion.
There the tragedy has now exceeded everyone' s expectations.
Firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the Member States to comment on these observations.
Article 276 of the Treaty states that the Commission should submit all the necessary information to Parliament in connection with the discharge procedure.
We have managed to discuss some of these instances within the committee and these sections have been deleted from the report, which has led to an improvement.

I would be extremely sorry if that were the case.
However, the Commission' s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved. This is to be regretted.
Firstly, on the intergovernmental conference system: a conference that drags on for weeks and months must become a thing of the past; it is not a model for the future.
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	yann_	doesn't get any answer :/
Europe is attempting to enlarge its borders and create an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Commission is convinced that the same should apply here.
We have presented various amendments with a view to improving the content of the report. In particular, these are designed to strengthen the position of small and micro-enterprises and their associations, to advocate jobs associated with proper rights and reduced working hours, and to call into question the Stability Pact and the consequences of implementing it.






The sports federations, such as UEFA and FIFA, have also submitted proposals to this effect.

This is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies.

In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.


Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities.

Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.


Finally, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their thorough work.

However, I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 22 and 31 in their current form because they implicitly say that no further controls need to be carried out.
For our part, we are also willing to introduce an amended proposal as quickly as possible so that we can achieve a positive outcome during the French Presidency.
Forests are, of course, important storages of C02 but the potential for expansion of forests in the EU is limited, even if welcome.
Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security, therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved.


The emphasis upon the knowledge - or information - society in this programme, as in the different national programmes of which we are aware, does in fact lead to a concentration upon innovators, entrepreneurs, new companies and new industries.

On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.
Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission.
The main reason for the problems of implementing trade agreements between the European Union and Israel, as has already been said, is the intractable problem of frontiers.

Mr President, just nine months - or perhaps I should say already nine months - have passed since the Helsinki resolution granting Turkey candidate status.

Amendment No 5 is covered by Amendment No 22, which is accepted as it stands.
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.
Naturally, I am extremely anxious that it should also be possible for the Treaty we signed in Nice to be approved, because that in turn is the prerequisite for its being possible to implement enlargement.

As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland, a peripheral part of this Union, I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures.

This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.

I do not understand the problem.

The docks in Gibraltar are type 'Z' .
In the case of definitive legislative acts approved by the Council, the reports include the results of any votes, and any statements for the minutes made by the Council, the Commission and the Member States.


It seems to me that at present it is in the interest of all the members of the Union that any closer cooperation within the Union should be established on a basis of respect for the Union' s legal system and institutions.

If this comes to nothing, then the government has to step in.

The theorising that preceded and continued throughout the European Year of Lifelong Learning and the considerable interest it raised in schools and citizens' groups made a major contribution to this.
I believe that we should be pleased about this.

That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.

Where there is no money to be won and no obligation to show a profit, there may quite simply be the desire to share these special opportunities, and sport undoubtedly has its place - indeed its foremost place - in such encounters.

They continue to report to the competent authorities on a periodic basis.

but can't find out how to start open office

There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.




The Socialists are unhappy with this type of vote, which looks more like Russian roulette than serious parliamentary work.
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.
To this data we must also add a factor which will distort the statistics and will change the landscape of the European Union in the next few years, i.e. the incorporation of the new Member States.
What is missing, of course, is a political superstructure for steering economic policy.

In some parts of our region, for example, children learn the languages of our neighbours as early as the kindergarten stage through play.

These are familiar topics, as Prime Minister Guterres has said, but this summit is not going to be another Luxembourg, Cardiff or Cologne: we want to take a completely new approach to these issues, which we have already tackled in the past, and, rather than taking each one in isolation, deal with them collectively and, at last, create an intervention system.

For that reason we are proposing that the Treaty should include a uniform and cohesive legal base for equality between the sexes, which will include all policy sectors.

BSE is a moral problem: over the decades agricultural policy has been constructed around agriculture, but now a veil of distrust is coming down over the sector that we, as institutions, cannot afford to allow.

Many of our fellow citizens are fearful of a future that been starkly portrayed to them for the past two decades.

We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.

Madam President, I too wish to add to the protests voiced by Mrs Villiers and Mr Alyssandrakis at the premeditated abduction of a Cypriot citizen. Not only is this man ill, but a bag of hashish was planted next to him so that he could be accused of drug smuggling, even though the abduction was carried out on a base belonging to Britain - a guarantor power and a member of the European Union.

I must repeat that the report stresses the importance of the objective of doubling, from 6% to 12%, the proportion of renewable energy sources in the gross domestic consumption of energy.

So I am extremely surprised that the members of the Austrian People' s Party are unable to endorse this resolution, which merely expresses an initial concern and is an initial call on the Austrian Government, and have chosen instead to give us a taste of the way the Austrian Government treats its government critics.

Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors. This would deal with disciplinary matters and help recover money which has been paid out unlawfully.
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
A maximum guaranteed quantity for the whole Community would not be a solution.


LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.


What we are about to discuss is really very simple: the respect, application and monitoring of the agreements subscribed to by the European Union, and compliance with the Treaties and international standards to which it adheres.
I am extremely pleased with it.








It is subsidiarity in action: European where necessary, national where possible.




Mr Posselt referred to fats and dioxin and the question of dioxin is under active consideration by my services and by myself at the moment as a result of the publication of the report of the Scientific Steering Committee within the last couple of weeks on this very issue.
This is a good basis and also one of the reasons why Parliament and Commission are in harmony about where we go now.

Madam President, I understood my good friend' s, Mr Seixas da Costa' s, remarks as a defence of the sanctions against Austria, and I should therefore like to ask him, as a matter of form, whether he was tabling this proposal as President-in-Office of the Council, and therefore on behalf of the Council, or whether it was on behalf of the 14 governments.


Lastly, Amendment No 4 refers to the protection of producers against pressures applied by the distributor to force them to extend the contract.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to add my thanks to those that have been expressed already.

Obviously we need to deal with this.

Does the President-in-Office not agree that failure to lift the sanctions now is undermining the democratic foundations on which this Union was established?



I therefore hope that, tomorrow, we will actually slap the Council of Ministers in the face by unanimously affirming the rapporteur' s four amendments.


That is definitely the best way of making information services available to all citizens.

In this sense, I have to say that my delegation and some in my group support Amendment No 61 tabled by Mr Maaten and Mr de Roo, in which the times are indicated when assurances can be given with regard to BSE inspections and other matters and which states that there can also be a time when the EU label will be applicable.
This matter of monitoring currency holdings and stability and the matter of whether the exception would not thus become the rule have lead to the motions for amendment.
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.


I should like to begin by highlighting and expressing my support for the innovations introduced by the current agreement, which dedicate 50% of the European Union' s total support to specific actions aimed at the sustainable development of the sector.
The trust of the citizen in the powers that be, and specifically in the European Union, is at stake.
It is supposed to lead to cheaper flights, a wider range of flights and no more delays.






What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?

The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations. So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.

We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move.
It is crucial that European aid has a direct bearing on the economic and social problems that are besetting the people of Zimbabwe.
The countries on the receiving end of the criticism decry "name calling" and are lobbying hard in advance to prevent any discussion, and this is exactly where the European Parliament, being so committed to the defence of human rights, can fully play its part.



This is very sloppy, very amateur and unacceptable as a way to treat this House.
The EU has a human rights duty and competence to make all different, all equal, a reality.

So it is too early, at this point in time, to contemplate further measures or sanctions.


India should be encouraged to look for and explore the full potential towards internal political solutions to meet the expectations of the Jammu and Kashmir populations in line with the possibility for enhanced autonomy as enshrined in its constitution.
He would kill them en masse and throw them into the sea.
The minimum level of legal protection in the Member States of the EU must not be allowed to slip to that which exists in the United States.
The original EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments of 1968 was an important landmark in this field of international private law, marking a departure from a previous patchwork of mainly bilateral treaties between various countries.



Their order books are full for a few more years, but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant.
The Commission has been quick to say that, in the future, all costs are to be borne by the manufacturer.
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?
Euro-Mediterranean collaboration is the main vehicle for interference in the internal affairs of the Mediterranean countries, and, ostensibly, all this is being done in the name of common prosperity, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems.
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.
try using suse's yast and synaptic together...hehe

The freedoms and rights of citizens include freedom from physical and mental harm.
My request was looked upon critically, whereas these kinds of party, where we are portrayed as vultures, are simply tolerated.
cause i need to use my scanner
We must also, of course, provide for the introduction of sport into the Treaty - if not in the short term, then at least in the medium term.
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.
Significant progress in this direction is a matter of urgency.
The Commission proposal for a Council regulation under consideration seeks to create a solid legal and budgetary framework to underpin actions taken under the various bilateral agreements signed between the EU and the six industrialised countries mentioned.


A paper this short is a farce.

Mr President, Europe normally finds it hard to assess the impact of government policy. That is not the case in this report.
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite amazing what excellent reports are produced, although the Commission basis is completely inadequate.
That is the alternative and - I am sorry to say so - I do not share the idea that the alternative is to reintroduce internal border controls by means of jointly run police stations, which would not be on the border, but thirty kilometres away from the border.
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.


And as if this were not enough, there are also the terrible disasters that constantly afflict the country.
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.
We would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the EU' s activities but consider that social policy is mainly a question for each individual Member State to decide upon.
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.
Mr Alyssandrakis, we shall see what we can do about this.
ogra, many people can't. I dont see how backports hurt anyone. There are people who want a) updated software and b) stability. Backports + warty is just that.
We need to formalise and accept the permanent ban which the Commission is proposing now and we need stringent health warnings and labelling to inform our consumers of the risks.

I therefore say to the Council: make your decision quickly now!
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.



I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union.
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.

According to the UN humanitarian agencies, several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, including some 500 000 children, have died prematurely because of the embargo, for lack of food, medicines or adequate care.

In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.
Inevitably it was an intermediate and preparatory summit which did not deliver satisfactory results on fundamental issues and it was therefore disappointing, and above all not very spectacular, apart from the only item not on the agenda - that is, Austria - and it was therefore also a rather thankless task for the presidency.
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.


It was originally scheduled for 7 September.

Report (A5-0367/2000) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council decision setting the terms for financial support to Guinea-Bissau in the fisheries sector [8263/2000 - C5-0361/2000 - 1998/0355(CNS)]
We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation.


I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.
After all, Article 6 (4) of Directive 92/43/EC states: "If, in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for the site and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected.
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?
This means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process.

I would appreciate the Commission's estimate as to the likely timing for achieving a full free-trade zone in the Mediterranean and how it intends to implement this.
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.
We therefore asked the President of the Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to carry out an internal enquiry, which we hope will take place during the mini part-session at the beginning of May.

New Commission initiatives are already in effect, or will shortly become effective.
Undertakings are subject to constant restructuring, new holdings, strategic alliances and friendly or hostile takeovers.
Because of this, the bodies will have to work in close cooperation with the EU and national courts of justice.
FuMaNcHu, laptop?

Mr President, it has already been said in the debates that we have suffered from the impact of the Erika tragedy, but the cleaning out of holds is equivalent to more than one Erika each year on Europe' s coastlines.
That is why I think we do indeed need a cohesion policy and support for cohesion in future.
Following internal political changes, the European Commission is also to prepare a viability study for Croatia which the Council hopes to be able to analyse immediately before or after the summer.


In order to overcome these disadvantages, the chemists of the agri-foodstuffs industry add artificial flavourings, flavour enhancers, firming agents, colorants, etc. What is more, with food distribution chains becoming ever longer, it becomes unavoidable to have recourse to preservatives and oxidation inhibitors.

The Commissioner is bound to be aware of the fact that Belgian public opinion has taken quite a knock and consumer confidence has fallen in the wake of the dioxin crisis. So much so, in fact, that a committee of inquiry was set up in the Belgian Parliament at the time of the crisis.







On this point, Mr Hager is correct.


ok zenwhen, thanks...

This success is reflected in the removal from the statute books of the hitherto fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection, the coherence of the relevant water directives at EU level, the legally binding nature of the measures taken pursuant to Article 4, the shortening of the deadline for complying with the aims of the directive, the satisfactory way in which the issue of costs has been settled, also in accordance with Ireland' s wishes, the introduction of the combined approach whereby limit values and quality objectives are established with a view to reducing the levels of pollutants, significant improvements over the common position regarding the requirements for groundwater protection and, finally, the inclusion of the goal and the definition of the OSPAR Convention with no stipulations in terms of time.
The Intergovernmental Conference of 2000 is taking place to make the Union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided.
There are one or two that went through that I have some doubts about, particularly Amendment No 7, which I cannot see as being environmental at all, or as contributing to the overall attempt to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances at ground level anywhere in the Union.
Mr President, this matter is one of the utmost importance.
Now, supranational rules and regulations for Europarties controlled by the big countries are being drawn up, with the Commission' s support, by the big parties in the big countries.

But victims must not suffer twice: firstly from a crime and secondly from the system.
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.

With regard to the report by Mr Cashman on public access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents, for which the vote on the draft legislative resolution was postponed on 16 November, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has informed me that it is not yet able to meet the two month deadline laid down in the Rules of Procedure.


Democracy is transparency, public accessibility, rule by the people, and participation.

Incidentally, I would also be grateful if you would include your position in this new wording, i.e. your position in relation to one of the countries, namely the United States, which you have now set out - indeed you have provided a very comprehensive overview of our relations with the United States.
Calendar of part-sessions of Parliament for the year 2001
In preparing the proposal, the Commission consulted several bodies independent from the manufacturers, who worked with experts from the Member States for a long time in order to find the appropriate level of strictness on decibels for the various categories of tyres for cars, vans and lorries.
The aim of the EU-Mediterranean partnership must be to redress the balance between the northern and southern regions of the Mediterranean area, improve people' s quality of life and promote understanding between the inhabitants of the various regions.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, to summarise today' s debate, there are basically three issues at stake here.
This approach is supposed to be global and regional and treats the Mediterranean Basin as a regional entity.


It therefore concerns me that there is no way of searching or taking soundings.

Please be assured that the sacrifice of Martín Carpena has not been in vain.


This is why it was with some hesitation that, in another resolution, we in the meantime urged that a position be adopted on America' s inclination to determine its own security unilaterally via the ABM system.

These are the modern means to be used.
see you

We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament.

All this, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, is the real challenge facing the common fisheries policy from economic globalisation.
Why then do we always have these proposed amendments in plenary?
And we shall make the same effort in the future, not because you are strict and we have to, but because it is in our interests to do so.

I would like to propose - and this is in fact correct in the German version - that we should forward this resolution to the High Representative for the CFSP.

We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.
I should like to remind the House that the Commission proposed to the Tampere European Council to adopt a single European asylum system.
okay, both back


I believe that his work has contributed a considerable amount to this Parliament' s understanding of a very technical and complex proposal and it is of course no easy task to translate it into a language which is accessible to the average citizen.



I am continually surprised, moreover, that those who are the quickest to call for an extension of a free-trade area, imposing the liberal model on terms that are extremely unfavourable for the countries of the South, are also the first to speak of interference, even neo-colonialism, with regard to human rights issues.

xmms is the sucky old player
cendrizzi: There's probably some info on the forums, but I have no personal experience with it.
I maintain my position and I now suggest that we move straight on to the debate on Fiji and the Solomon islands, as that is what our fellow Members are waiting for.
It is better to do one thing which is slightly inferior than to do a great deal of things which are downright inferior.

Excuse me, but could you put the question in a different way?




To prevent any misunderstanding, let me say that our aim here is not to subsidise the film industry but rather to ensure that more European films can be watched in Europe.
I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that, only a few days later, she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment, which is undoubtedly important, would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it, and this includes forest owners.
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.
I would like to inform you that, as you are aware, yesterday a tragic road accident occurred in Spain, near Soria, in which 2 drivers and 25 teenagers died.
Mr President, it came as a surprise to me as well that this debate was being squeezed in today.
Could you explain what the situation is?
In 1999 there were general elections to the Guinean Parliament, during which the international observers noted that human rights, democratic guarantees and freedom of information had been violated.



Therefore, it is the promise of long-term applicability and long-term economic contribution that justifies the expenditure of public funds.

I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.

All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.


The figure that is being attached to it is about 5% of the EU budget.
Why then do we discover that it is intended to increase the subsidy to wine growers by 64.5% next year, taking the budget to over EUR 1 billion?
We can monitor all corners of the Chamber.

The impossibility lies, therefore, not in the directive but in the current situation.
xskoulax: yes it does
Any meaningful migration policy cannot fail to take these considerations into account, for this demographic holocaust, soon to become an economic disaster, calls for proposals for migration policies which are liberal, antiprotectionist and geared to economic requirements and labour market demand, to counteract the prohibitionist and protectionist, nationalistic, ethnic, inhumane policy currently in force in Europe. To date, this has done nothing but criminalise immigrants, who are needed by the labour market, and deliver illegal immigrants into the jaws of crime, starting with the arrangements for their entry onto European territory and ending with their involvement in the black market and other unlawful activities.

Report (A5-0106/1999) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol setting out for the period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2002 the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé e Principe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé e Principe (COM(1999)0550 - C5-0305/1999 - 1999/0228(CNS))


I welcome the report, it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union.

However, the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of Greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone.
I would point out, however, that the practical result is that today, with a few exceptions and despite everything, this situation is under control in terms of security.
Well, this regional cooperation still leaves too much to be desired.

More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beef labelling was actually conceived as a quick way of regaining the public' s confidence in beef after a string of crises and scandals.

The main thrust of the report is that clearance of accounts for the expenditure financed by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF was a job well done.

As maintaining a list of undesirable persons constitutes an unacceptable and undemocratic act on the part of the Turkish Government, does the Council intend to look into the issue and to intervene with the Turkish Government at once to ask for the list to be scrapped?
NOOOOO!!!!!!

The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.



However, we do perhaps regret the lack of integration with other initiatives that she is pursuing, which is apparent if one reads her communication.


I admit that making this compulsory could be considered normal from the point of view of the consumer, but this is not yet the case in the Netherlands, where this suggestion is met with a great deal of protest.
Mr President, like Mr Lannoye, late last night I too was faced with the fact that the vote on my report at second reading is planned for 12.00 p.m.

As you are aware, we do not yet know if a new WTO round will even start and, if so, to what extent.
As a specific example of what military forces can do, I would refer you to the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Just think what the situation was like there for several years.

Nor should we be surprised if European citizens continue to lose confidence in these administrative systems.
How does the Commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers?
And we should not forget that both sides of industry also have an indispensable role to play as regards industrial change at the European and the social level.
bzflag is sweet
The bilateral decisions, not sanctions, which were taken by the 14 Member States in respect of Austria are political acts which one country is entitled to adopt in respect of another.
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my great appreciation for the crucial role which Parliament, and the rapporteur in particular, have played in the negotiations on this directive.
For these trade routes between America and Asia, the Mediterranean provides a valuable centre for unloading goods for northern Europe, which means that carriers do not have to make detours.


The ACP-EU delegation went to the Solomon Islands to study the ethnic tension.

We are constantly being faced with all kinds of states of affairs, blockades and such like, and I believe it would be of great benefit if more objective information on future changes could be provided so that we could perhaps prevent a few mistakes from being made, as might have happened in the case of the Titanic.

Mr President, in the European Union and in this Parliament, we must deal with what is essential for European cooperation, namely that which creates a stronger and slimmer Europe, and we must be very careful not to take on any tasks which more properly fall to the Member States.




Minister, it is a great pleasure to see you here again.



As the author is not present, Question No 41 lapses.
And fourthly, the restoration and stabilisation of peace, including after military intervention.

I welcome the fact that, under Article 5, the money for routine projects is to be separated from emergency aid measures.
We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories, indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement.
Mr Titley, I will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other MEPs.
One reason why there has to be a European cultural policy is that the nation states are no longer able to pursue their cultural policies alone.

In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet.

Sometimes, these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget.
In this regard, there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics.
In order to hamper the success of the opposition, the ruling party risked heightening tensions by conducting a tough election campaign and by making the unequal distribution of farmland the issue for mobilising the rural world and veterans of the war of independence.

These are cardinal amendments, to my mind.
I would unfortunately have to put this one in the category of cases showing what some of the problems are between the services in the Commission.

Unfortunately, the experience of NAFTA shows us that this target was not achieved automatically, because there is evidence that free trade has had an adverse effect on the lives of many people, exacerbated environmental damage, and marginalised wide sections of the Mexican population - all the more so as Mexican human rights NGOs have also reported a deterioration in the human rights situation since the interim agreement came into force in 1998.
The European Parliament should be aware that the elements I have outlined are intrinsic to the legislation and that Mrs Buitenweg and myself have come to a clear understanding with the Portuguese Presidency that, in return for our cooperation in accelerating parliamentary approval, those elements will form a minimum in the final directive agreed.

The Commission' s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society.


A single key is to suffice in future.
In that document we will be stressing the vital significance of greater regional cooperation and more trade and cooperation between the countries to the south and not just between Europe and the countries of the South.





The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.

For a long time now I been taking not of Charles Pasqua' s comments on gastronomy, and indeed on other matters, and so I was very interested to hear him speak, there is no question of that, even if I did not completely recognise the Europe that we are building together from his remarks and description.

Such a centre could be incorporated into an established body or foundation through the enlargement of existing competences, as proposed in the PSE resolution.
Indeed, this experimentation, under the guise of 'therapeutic cloning' is already patented, and the object of ongoing research.

It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.

The Commission has already pointed out to the Parliament' s Committee on Budgets that it intends to propose, in its preliminary draft budget for 2001, the financial means to maintain the Fund for the next five years.

Lastly, the moratorium and the precautionary principle: this is not a question of asserting a principle, the precautionary principle, which was established in the context of food safety, and transferring it wholesale to foreign policy.
Even if e-money can be used without limit on the Internet and for mobile telephones, this does not mean that it might not be counterproductive.

I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture.
It is not so long ago that we addressed this issue and produced a set of rules that were appropriate to the situation, and which Mr Blokland was seen to be happy with at the time and did not complain about.
The Community is not going to achieve the desired goal by creating a tangled multiplicity of such bodies.
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.

In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.
I do not want any further debate.
It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible, but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro.




The Member States have a major role to play in this respect and must make considerable efforts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safeguarding pensions is an extremely important task facing our age.
It seems to me, with some responsibilities in this field, inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart.

I was a rapporteur on this subject in 1992 and I am particularly interested in following legislative developments on the subject.
We continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy.
Why should a private-sector supplier be a priori any better at this than one under public ownership?

We have spent a great deal of money in this region and it would be gratifying if now and again people talked about the European Union' s contribution in Latin America, and not just about North America' s role.
This approach aims, as I have said, to support the inter-Korean reconciliation process in order to bring about peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.



But I too should like to say at this point that I do not see the letters drawing the Commission' s attention to the fact that companies may fold or jobs be destroyed following certain Commission measures as an illegal attempt at intervention, irrespective of whether the letters originate in Parliament or in a Member State and regardless of whether they come from France, Ireland or Bavaria.
This new mechanism will certainly meet a need, so much so that demand could soon exceed supply.
The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper - and I agree with this entirely - about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers, empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget.
Your institution is calling for a public prosecutor' s office for financial matters in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference.

The path may one day prove to have led to something which is the total opposite of all the promises which were given when the journey was begun.

Treenaks: done:)

But the cereal support level is too low for long-fibre flax and therefore acts as a disincentive to producers to grow this flax variant.

This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice.

I do not see eye to eye with Mr Bouwman on that score.
We must also require the prior approval of the recipient country before any trade can take place.
martin_, i realised what he was asking, its over my head though :D

By 2001, public and private investment should reach 21% of GDP and, in 2004, it should reach 23%, which would bring us very close to that objective of 24%, which was mentioned in the Commission' s White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness.

I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK.
In accordance with the Bible, God' s word, I consider the Jews as His chosen people, upon which lies the divine duty to be a "beacon for all peoples" .

I know that he debriefed Members right after the agreement was initialled: he phoned the honourable Member to inform him that he had finalised the agreement.



I will take this opportunity to insist, for the record, that, in Castilian, 'hooligans' is an anglicism for a type of specialised, usually British, troublemaker.

Some points even contradict the Mexican constitution.
By implementing the Helsinki criteria and having made progress in the country itself, Turkey has made significant steps towards these negotiations, which it is important to bear in mind. It has been gradually committing itself to implementing or to adopting a huge range of institutional and legislative changes.
In addition to this, as Mrs Carlsson said, the rates of duty on products from developing countries should be reduced.

On the other hand there are special police troops, which back the Christians.

Now, although I am German, it is certainly not my concern - I am speaking here not as a German but as the chairman of my group - to debate the constitutional situation in Germany, but in the countries of central Europe, the unfortunate impression has been given that new conditions have been attached to the enlargement of the European Union.




I stand by these two statements made by the Partido Popular party and make the point that Europe is no longer an international affair in our view and Parliament must mediate politically, not between the terrorists and the government, but between the Basque Government and the Spanish Government, between the PP and the PSOE and the PVN-EA, as this is what is presently lacking in Spain, over and above the terrorist violence.
But in the interests of passenger safety in Europe we cannot accept no decisions being taken on aviation until the supposed settlement of the Gibraltar conflict.

However, according to prison statistics, the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who, either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion, have never set foot in such a centre.
The ÅU has a penchant for waxing lyrical about culture, but while it preaches that cultural heritage is a basic factor in the individual identity and historical development of a society, it has done nothing to get the Elgin marbles returned to the natural and historic site of which they form an integral part, even as a gesture of respect for our cultural and historic heritage and for the need to protect historic monuments.
I will be the first to support this at second reading, if the Council makes the proposal, but we need to list clearly and to substantiate clearly where derogations are possible and under what conditions and for which Member State.

You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.

Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.


Nevertheless, I am pleased to be able to take the opportunity, as also requested by the honourable Member, briefly to mention a few priorities with regard to the future policy for the Community's fishing fleet.






Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and all those who have contributed to this draft resolution on the Commission's report on the operation of the insurance block exemption regulation.



There are cases where the fortunes accumulated by the leaders of these countries would be enough to pay off their external debt, so these are sensitive issues which need to be carefully considered.
The costs that impede are not only the fares, difficult as those often are, but also the inconvenience of pre-booking, of waiting in queues, of fitting in with timetables which provide low and variable frequencies; and then there are the risks of delays and cancellation due to weather or mechanical breakdown, or strikes which hold the islands to ransom from time to time.

It is quite logical, it is consistent!

Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members?
You may be sure that if this House approves the framework agreement, Members in my Group will watch very closely to ensure that it is actually adhered to.


I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people.


I have carefully read the Court of Auditors' report on the accounts for that year, particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds.




However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.

Many transport associations are themselves seeing it that way now.



Of course I agree that we should not at any stage prejudice political decisions which have to be taken at a later date.
He has outlined the matter quite clearly.

This paragraph does Parliament no credit.



We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation, by causing significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer.

But a mortgage is also an opportunity, because it can be paid off.
Yet it is vital to win over Eastern Europe, which still makes relatively good use of the railway network, to interoperability with Europe before everything switches to the roads.

I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.
i just did a sysupdate and it still runs fine




The compromise reached on 10 December by the Transport Council marked a step in the right direction.

I also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time.
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.

There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.
Wheat growers, in particular, will be affected very badly, which they already are because of a 15% fall in prices, but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops. This means, moreover, that, especially in the northern part of the EU, there will be further price falls in the offing.



The French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner' s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998, because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?
Insofar as there was ever faith in the euro, this faith has been eroded extensively since the euro has dropped in value compared to the Danish Kroner, the Swedish Kronor, the British Pound and the currency of many countries outside the European Union.

The Commission is aware that, for example, the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the United States.
Instead of focusing his attention on stepping up cooperation between the existing railway companies and enhancing the democratic say over these companies, so that benefits of the rail industry can be better enjoyed on a European scale and liabilities can be eliminated more effectively, he puts all his hope in competition and liberalisation.
Since France currently holds the Council Presidency, at this point I would particularly like to express our solidarity in the face of the terrorism in Spain, which is the most deadly in Europe at the present time.


That is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers.
We believe that this is good for consumers.
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork.
We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers.



I disagree entirely, however, with the means she puts forward and with the report' s proposals.


Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of an initiative that may bring about a mild improvement, when it will also help legitimise these institutions as a result.
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?
However, this is a very sensitive issue, and I want to raise it with the Bureau, so that the matter can be clarified, because if that is what we are supposed to have voted for, I think an extremely grave political precedent has been created.


B5­0725/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the danger of nuclear submarines;

tseng: were you able to restore it?
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?

The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.
I wish you much strength, pledge Parliament's support and assure you that this Parliament will have more to say on the issues of economic and employment policy in the future, as the people of Europe also expect.

This is an affront to human dignity and also signifies a commercialisation of the human body.

I would also like to say a few words about women's rights, an issue that I have chosen as a special theme in the report.
jordi: what changed?

I would also like to say, however, that we naturally expect the "opposition press" , or what remains of it, to denounce the current irregularities in political leadership in the city of Belgrade, for example, which is governed by the MRS, just as much as it justifiably criticises the Milosevic regime.
It cannot perhaps be said to be as urgent as it has been in previous years, but it is our judgement that we ought to follow up the resolution presented and adopted last year because of the serious situation in Chechnya.


Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?

We all know that our cultural and natural heritage risks being wiped out by activities which damage or destroy the urban and local fabric in which priceless examples of our cultural and natural heritage are to be found.
That is not the route that has been taken.




:)
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.

It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.

It is difficult to encourage someone who is genuinely at peace with their conscience.
In signing the action plans established by the High Level Group, the Tampere European Council of 15 October 1999 recognised that the European Union still lacks an overall approach to the immigration phenomenon which covers the political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit. This is an important point.

We were closer to the poor women, we were further out in the villages than I had expected and we worked more through Bangladeshi NGOs than I had expected.
In general, Mrs Buitenweg' s 55 or so amendments make the Commission proposal much more substantial.

If we look at Mozambique, for example, how long have we had to wait before real action could be taken?
In my opinion, this is a very difficult subject, and one over which we will lament the passing of the Portuguese Presidency, for, at least on this point, it maintained a position which, if not crystal clear, was at least less negative.



Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the Commission' s second great priority: the development of foreign policy and a genuine European security and defence policy.
On the one hand, a poet would say: "Woe betide the man who does not dare to dream great dreams!" but a statistician would reply: "Woe betide the politician who gets carried away on empty dreams and does not see or resolve the problems which are staring him in the face!"
I heard today at 11.30 a.m. that the forum of Jewish organisations in Belgium says that there will not be a trial.
It is unfair that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of Auditors concerning events going back many years, but the fact is that Mr Staes has done his homework and gone out into the field.
The answer is that the Council failed to reach a common position in December and the Commission is supporting the Portuguese presidency in its effort to make progress in parallel with the progress on this proposal.
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.

That said, it is also clearly absurd to exempt aviation from the duty to diminish greenhouse gases and ozone depletion and it is also a good thing to look towards an equality of taxation across the European Union, as Mrs Lucas has done, rather than grossly distorting differentials between different parts.
Mr President, we take a different approach to the important point raised by our colleague, Mr Brok' s question to the Council.
This is a question of achieving economic growth to satisfy businesses as well as protecting social aspects.



On this point the Commission can give a clear assurance that, where evidence exists of reduced national expenditure in a given region or regions, it will be particularly attentive with regard to the credibility of the overall figures.

heya, is there a way to use the live CD as a rescue CD? I"ve not been able to find it so far.....

The process of amalgamating farms and the buying-up of farm units by consortia pushing up prices unrealistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well.
This is taking a huge chunk out of the European budget. Would it not be possible, in imitation of customs in the Member States, to obtain insurance cover against the outbreak of certain animal diseases?
I would like to ask you what the reason is behind this procedure.
Indeed, as regards Amendment No 1, on Article 8(5) and (6) on commitology, your proposal for a EUR 5m threshold is, to be frank, somewhat disappointing compared to the level of EUR 25m we had proposed.
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.
Of course not everyone' s requirements have been met, including some of our own, but it is not always possible to achieve everything.
We have still not obtained proofs of this in all areas. We have heard excuses, often in a dismissive tone, from the Commission, as if it were the Commission which was to be giving us discharge, rather than the other way round.
The references to enhanced rights for third country nationals means, of course, rights for those who are legally resident.
In the framework of the new Transatlantic Agenda and in cooperation with the government of the United States of America, it has, for instance, carried out various information campaigns in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, to raise an awareness within the population and the public bodies of these countries.

However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States

Portugal has had a difficult presidency, with the collapse of the euro, and the collapse of the new economy, and, in Lisbon, had to deal with many problems like unemployment, the loss of Macao, the arrival of imitation port from South Africa, and even the arrival of the great criminal Rezala in your country, Mr President.
The resolution proposes to remedy some of the omissions in the present directive and to harmonise European legislative systems to align them with those that guarantee the most rights.
Numerous areas in which we can work have opened up, and they deserve our full involvement. Amongst these are the strengthening of democracy, poverty reduction, and the fight against Aids.
That is why we are also proposing that, at the end of the first year in which the scheme has been implemented, the Commission should present the European Parliament with a precise interim report providing, in particular, an update on the situation regarding each COM concerned.
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.




On the issue of biometric risks, which we have heard a lot about, clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk, which is longevity.
It only makes sense if we prevent this in unison and only then, Commissioner, does the White Paper on food safety, which you have presented, also make sense.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Amsterdam has at last paved the way for joint action in the area of asylum law and refugee and immigration policy.
As far as gene transfer is concerned I believe measures must be foreseen in the new Directive to control the release of GMOs which can outcross with other plants.




To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing?
Around 3 million people of Turkish origin live in Europe and it is for this very reason that our Commissioner ought perhaps to consider in the future how we are going to resolve this problem reasonably and humanely in the coming years.


Riddell: great

What particularly worries me is the fact that, through fundamentally violating its own treaties, the European Union is attempting to by-pass its own internal rivalries by indirect means.
As to your second question, on the sentencing of these Iranian Jews, I totally agree with your analysis of the situation.
That is why I think that this Amendment No 3 which Mr Piecyk has drafted as rapporteur is excellent.

There is a real lack of prospects for young farmers, as well as a significant decrease in the numbers of farmers in general, with an increase in the age of those remaining.
In my speech I shall focus on the electoral system.
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.

We may well be able to go further by 2010, but this is something that can only be decided when we know how Member States will meet their Kyoto targets.
So my reply is 'yes' .



I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.

I would therefore first of all like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and everyone who cooperated with him for the excellent and rapid progress that has been made with this.
These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control, which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution.

It is regrettable that in committee this debate has declined in some ways to business versus industry.
Firstly, I should like to stress the need for Community participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency, which would enable the European Union to make a vigorous and coherent contribution to the struggle against doping.

A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.

What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.

A lot of progress has been made, but there are still political and economic areas in which women are under-represented.

B5­0736/2000 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on accidents involving nuclear submarines;




I think the first annual report of this new European Parliament is thorough and timely.

the NM bof notes equate Ubuntite with activist, so that may not be the best term for use on the agenda
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.
Finally, I should like to note that, with regard to traditional sailing ships, whose exemption we initially secured by drafting a specific list, we have now decided to apply the Marpol convention to them with regard to sewage.
and i leave the the 'fetch software from the network' alone?
I would like to specify two. One is the EU' s say.
It is a major challenge, a foreign policy which the Community institutions must undertake to pursue in order to provide the Union with a political and cultural project which will bring about peaceful coexistence and growth in the face of different territorial and cultural conditions, and, putting aside the myths and legends of days gone by, make the Mediterranean a genuinely peaceful area, and not one of conflict or of abuse of power or where impoverished immigrants lose their lives attempting to reach Europe.



Our Parliament has the responsibility of restating this, not by rushing into anything, but simply by remaining consistent with our earlier positions.




It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.


Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.
Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated. Here, we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety, even extending beyond the European Union, for the standards are established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is a supranational body.
From then on, they can no longer move around within the Schengen area until they have obtained a residence permit.


As soon as a matter becomes urgent, it cannot be postponed.
Maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far, when and if appropriate, is the right way to proceed in this context.

I shall be happy to do so, Mrs Napoletano.
From this point of view, the concern about small enterprises expressed in the parliamentary report is well-founded.
Further than that, how quickly will the high-level group on the future of social protection begin to move into the realm of a convergence strategy for social protection that this House has called for?
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.

The simple answer, Mr President, is 'yes' .

The implementation of this network, undoubtedly the most effective cooperative network, was the result of the action programme adopted in Dublin in June 1990 by the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the twelve Member States at that time.



We could possibly agree provisionally on a tariff quota ruling that is WTO compliant, but on condition that a date is specified on which the tariff only system will be introduced.
2005-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	IcE-bOy	hoary? anybody can pass me a source from hoary ?
Comments were made about the Council' s absence during the address by the Austrian President to this Parliament.
These are estimated at EUR 100 billion, accounting for some 2% of the gross domestic product of all the European Member States.
Similarly, removing restrictions for small and middle-sized industries - whether they have to do with complex bureaucratic procedures, the acquisition of venture capital or questions of taxation - is a vital step on the path to improved competitiveness and prosperity.
that line is actually 2 commands

I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations.

This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart and once again, I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it.
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.
There are, however, two points that I would like to mention here.

The euro has successfully delivered low inflation, rising growth, falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges.
That is why I shall fight to ensure that we continue to have public intervention in Europe.

We are asking right now for a transition to a new society, to an economy based on innovation, and on the information and knowledge-based society.
Mr President, that honours you greatly.

Mrs Ferrer' s report contains a whole host of proposals and demands that deserve our unqualified support.


To conclude, the situation in the Horn of Africa, in both political and humanitarian terms, is at the centre of our concerns.
Relations with Russia are of vital importance.
So let us be realistic, please.
It is truly contradictory that this Parliament cannot obtain a Council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this.
We see this as a step forward.



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in general, the Commission' s proposal for a regulation on a voluntary labelling programme is to be welcomed, and Mrs McNally has produced an excellent report on it.


We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.

Let me set out for honourable Members what we are doing to alleviate the present crisis.



Family reunification enables the family unit to be protected and makes the integration of third-country nationals into Member States easier.

It has the support of those sectors which are most sensitive to the problem of residues and the fight for sustainable development.

But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.
hehe
- I voted against the report on the trans-European high-speed system (A5-0112/2000).
However, I feel that this is a great step forward, and we look forward to the adoption and signing of this framework agreement in a few minutes' time.
A further advantage of wood is that it involves fixing large quantities of CO2 over long periods.


The Joint Supervisory Authority, or JSA, has had quite inadequate resources.
However, we hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to mobilise these governments through their endeavours and that an effective action of this kind will be instigated at the Conference scheduled for 19 and 20 May, in which both institutions are to take part.
The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters, the paedophiles and the pornographers, than to industrialists.
My second point relates to the very concept of complementarity, which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field, but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am, of course, perfectly willing to start by making the requested statement on fisheries relations between the Union and Morocco.



So I think we should ask ourselves a few questions.
And, of course, we should mobilise local society and regional bodies and ensure that they are more closely involved in road safety issues by addressing the people directly. At the same time, the information campaign must, of course, continue to run, using cleverer ways of getting through to the public, especially young people.
That brings us to the end of the explanations of vote.



What proposals, for example, will the Commission come forward with by June this year on social inclusion, as it was challenged to do in the Lisbon conclusions?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	is there an unofficial ubuntu website that people find to be helpufl?
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.



A document clearly laying out such rights, and making it clear where and how these rights could be exercised, would be valuable. But if that was all we were doing in the Convention then we should have left it to a team of academics, who frankly could have done it better than a group of 60 politicians.
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
We should not kill it off until we are sure it is not being effective.


I want to dissociate myself from demands such as that we should cut my country' s delegation in the European Parliament by one third.


I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.

Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 46 to 78 will be replied to in writing.
We know from experience that the Union' s consensus position is the method that you have come up with in order to avoid adopting any serious position in Geneva.

I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament.


In view of the fact that the Union is to undergo enlargement and acquire some new members before long, we must take account of the new situation during the accession negotiations even now.
The COST secretariat has already produced some commendable work.
This is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group.
Amendment No 29 is very important for producers, above all perhaps for small producers in vulnerable areas.


Motion for a resolution (B5-0505/2000) by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the provision of a common European security and defence policy, with a view to the European Council of Feira
This is certainly not the thrust of the report, which is why it must be rejected.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I prepared a proposal for an amendment on this matter myself, stating as reasons for the issue specifically the above-mentioned prioritisation of values, where public health is the first.
The fact is that we should be proud that we have developed a society which is so attractive that people wish to come and join us, but we should perhaps also be rather ashamed that our development aid policy has not been more successful in reducing the push factors in some of the countries of origin.

This is irrespective of how fair the European negotiating position is in terms of trade.






This instrument for the development of the private sector in developing countries is in accordance with the thinking which inspires the new position of the European Union in its cooperation policy.
But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds.
That is why we have tried to use MEDIA to complement what the Member States should be and are doing, but that is not enough either, and some speakers have justifiably mentioned the abortive experiment with a guarantee fund in the past.

Help us to be more precise with the road-map because we want to follow it.
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.



Mr President, I am grateful to the honourable lady.

Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.

The President-in-Office said in his reply that the Council will remind the Egyptians of their responsibilities and wait until they have signed the association agreement and can bring an institutionalised political dialogue to bear.
I would like to ask you, Mr President, to change the admission procedure in Brussels back to how it used to be: you identify yourself, a badge is made and you are admitted.

To summarise our point of view, we can accept Amendment No 1 of the Committee on the Environment.

We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula.

On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?
Those who are at the receiving end of other people' s reckless pursuit of profit deserve our solidarity, certainly as an interim measure.
I am concerned: is it that he is deaf?


star-merge


They very often live as closed groups juxtaposed to one another within the same territory, but largely in separate settlements and urban areas.
At the same time, I do not want to claim here that it is a panacea.



It is always there, but local and national bodies can stand up to criticism better perhaps than this younger institution of the European Union, which is less accepted.
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.

To that end, let me point out the primacy of food safety and consumer protection, and the consequent need for tighter controls to lend credibility to the decisions that are taken as well as the need for a European food agency to be set up quickly.
After the adoption of two amendments:Ford, Glyn (PSE).

It is now for the Council to take the necessary and urgent political decisions which will allow the single aviation market to be supplemented with a single air traffic control system.


Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.
To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service, it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical.


This is the Commission' s own survey.




It is not a new problem, as Members of Parliament will know - particularly Members who have been on delegation visits to other countries.



The European Union must respect the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and which result from the common constitutional traditions of the Member States on general principles of Community law.
We need more resources for the implementation of specific schemes, and we need closer cooperation between the Commission and the tourism industry to define codes of ethics.
2005-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	kergan	try enlightiment , ommm session, adding it

The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:

It would allow Parliament to participate fully in the process, not just by swapping shopping lists with you.
I can well understand why Commissioner Verheugen is somewhat vexed by the fact that candidate countries are being toured in the name of the Council and the various Member States and being promised that they can definitely join our club one year or the other.

Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.
Will the Commission insist on its right to participate?
it only says pd when I run groups

I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.
While this dialogue can and does play a role in the transformation of human rights issues in China, it will only bear fruit if the European Union speaks and acts as one.
They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment.
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.

What are we actually doing in terms of the accession discussions with these countries to make our opinion abundantly clear that this is unacceptable?
srbaker: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=66325

Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?

I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet. Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report.

But late in the evening is often the time for cultural activities, so we are not really doing anything unusual.

This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.

She had reached her goal under her own steam, but she had made so many sacrifices along the way that she had become a woman whom I do not wish other women to take as a role model. For women who made their way into politics, diplomacy, etc. many years ago, are women who had to make huge sacrifices.
Like Mrs Terrón, I am also from a country, Spain, in which we unfortunately witness hundreds of deaths and disappearances in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts.
Uncomment the following two lines to fetch updated software from the network?
In fact, a new wave of neo-liberalism swept through Lisbon and gave the EU its marching orders in the global economic war.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Barnier.

The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.
Democracy is sidelined, supposedly for the good of the citizens. But then is that not how Europe usually works?

I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.
I consider that this would be extremely unfortunate.
I should point out that this figure for agricultural policy actually makes provision for the draft budget for agricultural policy to remain under the ceiling decided in Berlin because the Commission proposal includes shifting EUR 300 million from the agricultural budget to foreign policy, yet still there is such a high rate of growth for agricultural policy.
The most effective measure is to strengthen production in the region of origin, which is more justifiable both environmentally and economically speaking.
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.
A distinction must therefore be drawn between processing aid for long-flax fibres and aid for short-flax fibres and hemp fibre.


Applicant countries can now take solace from the fact that the EU has reformed its internal decision-making procedures so that the mechanics of the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner.




I would like to say a few things about the situation in Burma, and in Indonesia, and about the child soldier phenomenon.
The Union continues to attach great importance to stable development in South Africa, not only for the sake of the people there, but also because this is in the interests of the development of its neighbours north of the Limpopo.
Your report, Mrs Karamanou, is a fine example of the importance of the political texts drawn up in this Parliament.
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.
The European Parliament should adopt a harder line in order to support the principle of non-violence. This is why this resolution is necessary.

We also belong to a party that was forged in the struggle for democracy, and one of whose greatest concerns has always been the steadfast promotion of human rights.
Report (A5-0055/2000) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication [COM(1999)256 - C5-0094/1999 - 1999/2099(COS)] on countering racism, xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries


It will even be more in the 2000.
The stepped approach which has been brought in must not be used to simply give a redefinition of working time such as removing meal breaks or time spent on call but not actually treating patients.
Kamion: the ibook thingy can compile only on 6xx
We gladly accept complaints by e-mail and many of them contain well - presented allegations of maladministration.
At the second meeting with the support group for the peace process in Colombia, held in Bogotá on 24 October last year, the Commission stated that the Community' s support for President Pastrana' s peace efforts would amount to EUR 105 million during the period 2000-2006.


Moreover, the recent executions force us to revisit the conditions for European aid.
to make sure you got 3d
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.
what about?
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.

In fact, such a charge would be a more subtle instrument since it could actually be calculated to reflect both the amount of fuel used and also, by factoring in the efficiency of the aircraft's engine, the amount of pollutants generated.

The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.

Misfortune, misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries. They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married.

As regards the practical side of the proposal, I fear that this amendment would lead to varying levels of support in different Member States and to dramatic fluctuations in the level of aid within a short time.
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.
Of course, during the transition period, and until all products have been fully liberalised, the agreement will be more beneficial to Mexico than the European Union, but this asymmetry also takes account of the levels of development and competitiveness of the European economy as compared with Mexico' s.




It is not sufficiently justified by the fact that the Union' s forest area has grown since the last round of enlargement.

It is not divorce, alcoholism or anything else that encourages this behaviour.


Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.

Commissioner, why did ECHO not foresee this and foresee that food was needed there when so many people were threatened?
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting

The truth is that there is currently no such alternative.
This patent is no isolated case, however.
We have renewed them three times, and we believe that the time has come to include the fundamental principles in the Treaty so that we will not find ourselves in legally dubious situations, such as the case of the meeting which I have just mentioned.
The personnel available to us include very few post-doctoral teachers and we do not have sufficient staff.
At the moment, this criterion is the weightiest consideration.
Mr President, the compromise that has been reached is a great success for environmental and consumer protection.
jdub how do I sudo mysql? sudo mysql -u <myusername> -p?
Most herds in Britain are not closed herds and therefore animals come in from all over the place.

I must simply therefore ask, if we are being accused of withholding something, that you specify what has been withheld, because it is only on this basis that we can clear up misunderstandings or give you more information and this should not fail because of the Commission.



We would like to know how the presidency has dealt with this correspondence.

Belgium has started to use such a measuring technique in the wake of its dioxin crisis.
Our minimum demand is that Parliament be treated as an adult which has to request that the Commission take certain responsibilities, but which also has to participate actively in European construction on behalf of the European citizens.
Denmark offers the world' s highest level of financial aid to refugees and therefore attracts many who are merely economic refugees. And that is not what the Convention on Refugees is about.

Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.

Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.

bob2: a bug in baz?
Higher quality but smaller quantities, more stringent controls and the implementation of emergency measures are the order of the day.

To end, I disagree with Mrs Wallis' solution, despite the fact that we have shared this adventure, because I believe that at the end of the day her solution does not offer more protection to the consumer, since it only protects the consumer which a company has targeted.
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.
That is why I voted for these amendments.
I believe the scandal of abuse of safety at Sellafield is a European question.

In any event, however, controls will be needed, otherwise we will face the gradual collapse of our societies' structures, which, if the truth be told, match the aims of globalisation too well not to suit Europe' s enemies to a tee.

does that mean that there is no update available?




This new system will make it possible to have an overall view of the implementation of the additionality principle, including for Objective 2, which as you know, presented great statistical problems during the previous period.
We need to facilitate public administration structural reform in the countries where excessive red tape is a barrier to private investment and bring the social protection and taxation systems into line with the requirements imposed by the new economic rules and with the constraints established by the Stability and Growth Pact.
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.
Madam President, I would like to speak against this proposal.


This is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture.
I shall not, therefore, be voting for the present amendment.




If the decision is interpreted as it already has been by some people in this debate, namely as saying that the transposition and transitional periods for doctors should add up to nine years and that there should, above and beyond that, be the possibility of an additional three years' extra time, then we arrive at a total period of twelve years.

The unwillingness of the Commission is, however, with apologies to the Commissioner, apparent to everyone.
In this context, I would like to thank Mr Mombaur for his resolution' s support for the importance of the separation of producers and operators of transmission networks.

thng the gods


The aim of the Schmitt report is clear: "To re-enhance the reputation and substance of the right of asylum, the qualification procedure should be tightened up, and abuses resolutely curbed" .

It is important to remember that point.


Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?
I therefore expect the Commission and the Council to demonstrate together the same strong and combined political will that the European Parliament is displaying with this motion for a resolution.
These difficulties - mostly of a political character - remain and need to be tackled by Africa and Europe, both separately and jointly.

We have already had the opportunity to debate this in great detail, especially assistance in the Balkans.

Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.


It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.

I hope that this is a misunderstanding.

Continental Europe took its cue from England, adopted these laws and also enshrined them in international conventions, doing so from the very outset. In view of globalisation and Europeanisation, there is without doubt a need for the European social dimension in the 21st century.
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.
That will best be dealt with by removing the remaining barriers to the real Internal Market and attending to the implementation of the Lisbon decisions, with state decisions and investment in infrastructure according to the Swedish model, without simply leaving everything to market forces and sighing with relief.







So what is to be done?
You also propose to amend the definition of indirect discrimination and one of the speakers also mentioned this.
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.
In order to achieve all of this, and despite the criticisms that Mr Hernández Mollar has just presented to the House, which related specifically to action by Parliament and the effectiveness of this action in some of these countries, Parliament' s commitment must be serious and consistent.

This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us.



Do you wish to add anything else?
if i can get this working, fai is going to die an ugly death
Mr President, the Committee on Cooperation and Development has been extremely critical in its appraisal of what became of the development and cooperation expenditure in 1998.

Chemical substances are no longer banned because they are also harmful to human health, but in line with a new principle that harmful substances do not belong in the water.
Apart from industrial competitiveness, of course, as Mr Desama says, we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right.
What can be done about this?



What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a known fact that, if death from radioactive weapons is due to human insensitivity, then deaths from road traffic accidents are due mainly to human stupidity.
The information must be easily intelligible to all.




They have that one too :)


However, if it were to be adopted I would consider it a disturbing sign of protectionism It would be unfortunate if liberalisation, which has taken such giant leaps forward in the US, Europe and elsewhere over the past few years, were to start going backwards in the US.
Anti-Semitism must cease to be part of the history of the European Union and the world, for the Jewish people have already suffered far too much.

Their threats have to this day prevented the French government, for example, from introducing pension funds.

This particular question involves the problem of non-recognition by the Turkish authorities of the Assyrian-Chaldean community under the terms of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923.

In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.

Mr President, my point of order relates to Rules 148 and 135 regarding the distribution of the minutes and particularly regarding roll-call votes.

I have also noted that my dear friend, Mr Dell'Alba, has had his grumbles printed as an appendix to my opinion.
Lisbon will be judged on this, i.e. on whether or not we are capable of integrating the public and private economies in an original and enterprising manner.

Licence fees for ship owners have been considerably increased, from EUR 20 to EUR 25 per tonne.
Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution.





I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept.

Mr President, Iraq was at war with Iran from 1980 to 1989.
It is about trafficking not only from China, but also from certain other countries not far from the EU.
War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect.
On the other hand, I must also make a number of critical comments.
At present, there is still a 50% limit on state aid in relation to the overall cost of any given project, but this percentage could even be raised to 60% in special cases envisaged in the programme.
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.




I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.



If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not.
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.

One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.

I can indeed see it happening that, if we do not have a quorum on Thursdays, we will need to discontinue the sittings on Thursdays.
I would therefore say that the most enduring teams should be built up from scratch and not simply bought up.



There is work to be done, and work is being done.

ogra, ok..

The Committee highlights the importance of appropriate training for women, moving beyond the traditional mould, promoting on-going training, specialisation and the integration of women into the phenomenon represented by new technologies, so that society may gain a large number of highly qualified women whose participation at all levels - business, political and social - results from both qualitative and quantitative criteria. It also requests that a new priority line be added to the e-Europe initiative, bearing in mind that the information society has enormous potential for women, not only with regard to training and access to knowledge, but also because of the opportunity of new jobs or new working methods which may help to reconcile family life.

In order to keep our brainpower, to attract the best brains and to train them further, we must make massive investments in research and development.


I believe that the whole of this House and also the representatives of the Council and the Commission are included in this group, not only the ecologists, but all those who are concerned about this type of problem.
Mr President, there is no need to repeat what my colleagues Mr Goodwill and Mr Whitehead have said regarding the significant agreement that we have reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.








The African people have their own plans and want to develop themselves, but want help in order to achieve this.

The ban on snuff, which applies in all EU countries except for Sweden, ought therefore to be lifted.

Given that the embargo is continuing, as is the harsh winter, does the Council intend to take steps to extend the 'Energy for Democracy' programme as quickly as possible and to cover the needs of hospitals and schools?


We are at the very beginning of an explosion of this industry on this continent.
But, let us be frank here: minorities are minorities.

B5-0079/2001 by Mr Seguro and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the earthquake in El Salvador;

The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.

We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly concur with Mr Morillon' s suggestion that we abandon the hypocrisy with which we sometimes deal with certain real problems for reasons of political or other expediency.

While everyone is in agreement in condemning the considerable number of road accidents in the various European Member States, the EDD Group is unable to agree completely with Ms Hedkvist Petersen' s report on the appropriate means to tackle the subject, for the solution cannot be ever more European authority, more money and more criminalisation.
It is perhaps better to begin something late, but to begin with all the guarantees in place, than to find half way through that the studies have not warned us of some difficulty or other, meaning that we have to go into reverse, which would cause even greater delays.
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.

Our right to existence as a nation was taken away.

Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the regulation must be effective because it is a voluntary instrument.
We declare a ban and then we wash our hands of the matter.

As has been indicated several times by the European Ombudsman, it is important to safeguard the rights of individuals through improved confidentiality, better access to documents and justification of the European Commission' s decisions on classification.
Nor can it really serve to unlock the full potential of the audiovisual industry to create jobs and, of course, to produce a critical mass of cultural content.
I would ask with respect that the Commissioner, in the interests of probity, satisfy herself fully as to the genesis of this regulation in question to ensure the impact of its roll-out on the aviation industry world-wide.

What happened in the case of Mr Pelinka did not come about by chance or coincidence.



linux_mafia: with a scanner o.,o

Crucial to how the directive will operate is the question of how it will be implemented and monitored.
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.

That is why it is key for us to establish our priorities here and to make a start on demarcating the various competences.
The Union' s finance package will be an incentive to further investment in Turkey and, in the process, will also promote and consolidate democracy and human rights.
It should be introduced in such a way that the charge would be less for the unavoidable long haul journeys than it would for short flights for which there is a more environment-friendly alternative.

I would be interested to know how the President-in-Office of the Council views the sale by auction of UMTS licences.
We should remember that, in October 1998, once NATO considered that the first planned attack on Serbia in order to help the Kosovars was over, because Milosevic had allegedly given way and allowed unarmed OSCE observers into the country, that it was precisely at this point that this Information Act was issued and began causing so many problems for the independent media: and now we are looking at the result.

The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.
That is often the case with historical new departures.





pozac: yes gdm. tried startx, reboot, restart gdm
This ought not, however, to stop us trying to devise common assignments and strategies for preventive work, which is perhaps the most important foundation stone in the fight against drugs.
Indeed, all the appropriations for Kosovo have in fact been tied up already.

Consequently, in my opinion, broad guidelines for economic growth and a rise in employment should include measures to render the European market more competitive and increase job flexibility.
Then there is not just the question of citizens' rights: the rights of communities need to be better defined, as do the rights of peoples, those peoples which are under threat, on the one hand, from globalisation, which wants to standardise everything, and, on the other hand, from a return to a single, centralist, oppressive nation-state.



This will be the enduring image of Feira.
We cannot separate from this issue the current political and military position in Ethiopia.
Action is not limited to legislation.



Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?






Mr President, the 1999 annual report of the European Central Bank is not terribly forthcoming on the subject of the main question that all observers are asking: why has the euro, which was presented as a strong currency, turned out in the end to be a weak currency?




What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?
And it would be just as easy now for the Member States and their Ministers of Finance to declare that taxes should not be touched at all.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her persistence.
For all these reasons, we believe that, if the intention is to promote short sea shipping in a realistic and effective way, it is essential to reorganise the current provision of port services, by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs.
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.
I am pleased that the Commission really has taken note of the problem and intends doing what it can to ensure that the payments are made more quickly.




I would therefore ask you, Mr Duisenberg, to clarify what the limits will be for the Danish ERM 2 agreement and to answer the following questions.
nonono

I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening.

But we are carrying out a considerable amount of research in relation to this and a considerable amount of money is being spent on this.
That is the clear aim of the amendments in the name of Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleagues and this is consistent throughout all the amendments on behalf of the EPP - the so-called European People's Party - which actually reveals itself in its amendments as a party for some of the people but not all of them.


However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.
Child labour is still widespread, despite the recent progress made and initiatives presented by the government and industry.

I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.
It is, of course, one of the Commission 's tasks, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to propose measures on the entry into, and residence, in the European Union, of third-country nationals, primarily with the undeniably admirable aim of bringing about an approximation of the legal provisions of individual Member States on the conditions governing the admission and residence of third-country nationals.

We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit.

But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged.



I think, then, that we have a good result and I want to thank everyone involved.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure there are still many more questions.
and its not FUD
thats for the old xserv

whats the url to get new gnome themes??

It is not a question of the popping of champagne corks between Brussels and Strasbourg, that is an irrelevance if I might put it politely.

May I welcome the Commissioner to Parliament today on behalf of all of us.
We advise that this implementation be accelerated.
A further seven victims have been murdered by an organisation whose strategy is clearly, henceforth, one of attempting to defeat democracy by the use of terror.


In this respect, the European Union must be a prime agent for peace, but it must also provide strong support for the efforts of those organisations which the international community has entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the victims of conflicts and defending their rights.
Instead of a reduction in the means, this will now lead to an increase, which is a little bizarre, to say the least.


In sum, I am convinced that the facility will help us both materially - I would have loved to have had it in hand when we launched the Energy for Democracy scheme last autumn - and institutionally by providing a concrete Commission contribution to the evolving ESDP.




Mr Maaten' s report is a step in the right direction, but is only one step, because the fight for life, for health, is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all.


That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.





The result of an EU Charter would be an endlessly complicated morass of legal and constitutional problems.
It is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that EDF money does not facilitate a coup d'état or provide additional budgetary room for manoeuvre to enable dictators to oppress their people.
There was broad agreement that NATO, as the institution that had assumed responsibility for handling the Balkan crisis, should be charged with assembling information from all those involved regarding the use of depleted uranium, the location of military contingents, and all medical data.


i need a good public jabber server. i've had a bad experience with some. any recommendations?

I listened to Mr Segni' s speech.
Last week, he was accused of wanting to saw the legs from under Commission President Prodi' s chair.

I would merely ask you to be aware of this.
The rapporteur, quite rightly, pointed out that under the EC Treaty, the Council may, in principle, confer implementing powers on the European Commission, but only in "specific cases" can the Council reserve the right to exercise these powers itself and, clearly, this is not applicable in the case in point.



I am surprised that permission is granted for this kind of thing, because my request to set up an exhibition for the handicapped, organised by myself, was turned down last week by the same College of Quaestors.
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.

(Applause and laughter) The Quaestors are working hard on their behalf and we are waiting for the Finnish television channel.

Certainly Parliament as a whole was of similar mind, hence the Conciliation Committee on which I was privileged to serve.


Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.


I am especially pleased that this has been made possible for me on the 50th anniversary of Robert Schuman' s appeal to France, Germany and other countries to enter into a common economic policy on steel and coal.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has not simply commented on the Commission report - we welcome the priorities and measures put forward in it.
It refutes the principle of not expelling people before considering whether they are being sent back to a safe country.



This hypocrisy is intended to conceal the fact that the legislator is more concerned to reassure employers that their factories may be operated profitably than to guarantee the health and safety of employees.


So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.

We shall no doubt discuss this issue again, but I hope that this evening' s debate will be welcomed as a step forward in the issue.
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.

It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.
What is more: Moldavia is linked with neighbouring Romania both culturally and politically. If Romania falls under the scope of the Stability Pact, so does Moldavia, therefore.
If that is the case then it is good news indeed.
We are well aware of the powers of the Union, and we know its arsenal. It uses the environment to infiltrate everywhere; it uses our water pipes to spread its tentacles into national policy.
And finally there is the investment deficit.
For that reason I believe that a policy like this of taking small steps at a time is quite in order in this matter, and I would also ask how one aspect of this one-step-at-a-time policy is going, in other words the directive on a single market for additional pensions.


I am pleased to bear glad tidings from my own country.
I hope that with the Parliament's understanding we will be able to ensure over the years ahead that our external programmes are as effective and rapid as we all want them to be.

On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is my view that protecting cultural heritage is a task for the Member States.

That should offer them the opportunity of contributing to the SLIM initiative, either directly or indirectly, and of being informed of the progress made.
The usefulness of this proposal is limited, to say the least, certainly in the short term.


The Railway Infrastructure Package agreed by the Transport Council last December was the result of some very difficult negotiations.

Let me remind Mr Clegg, if necessary, that, in consideration of its service-related aspects, the agreement on China' s accession would in any case be subject, in principle, to the consultation procedure envisaged under Article 300.

Transhipment has become common practice and frequently fish products from one Member State which cannot be sold within the Union due to exceeding the TAC are sold as imported products or as originating from another Member State.
Transport should also be as clean as possible and in that respect too, short sea shipping meets high requirements.
In order to obtain effective data protection, more than effective supervision is required.


We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action.
In addition, I have tabled an amendment which I hope the Commission and Council will support, requesting the Commission to submit a new proposal as early as the year 2003, in which it might like to outline the overall framework for a new trade policy and philosophy.
In June we shall be holding the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg, at which important decisions will be taken in this area.





I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved.

Let us not be beguiled by arguments about harmonising taxation, because harmonised taxes under socialists have only one way to go and that is up.

I am, however, of the opinion, that we need to work a proper five-day week, which is not happening at the moment, if the number of MEPs in attendance today is anything to go by.
paulproteus: hm, feeding the logs into those wikis?

This can already be considered, per se, as a significant step forward, reinforced by the establishment of the European Judicial Network and other initiatives to modernise and increase the effectiveness of systems to prevent and combat crime.

The perpetrator makes the profit; external costs are left for others to pay.
It is a very good report.
We need to make the fibre flax and hemp sector more market-oriented so that it is able to make an effective, indisputable and useful contribution to the economy and is no longer the target of public criticism.
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.
We have a Central Bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation.

The choices seem clear, the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive.

2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: ubuntu is debian, i hear. so...
And if that is making profits for Turkey, then fair enough, but making profits for California!

truluko: yes
At the end of the day, we will have no choice but to deal with this knowledge in a responsible manner by trying to circumscribe it.
The few independent TV and radio stations in Serbia are being harassed and persecuted in order finally to be closed down entirely.
Mr President, before I start on the subject of tyre noise, may I make a more general point to the Commission.
A few weeks ago, taxi drivers in Brussels were refusing to take Austrian passengers.

I have the Council' s common position of 9 December 1999 before me.

Consumer confidence however, requires more than traceability.


After all, the Commissioner is here!
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.



To pursue the voting as a block vote today would, to my mind, be unfortunate.





ChrisC_, which server?

Very clearly, the importance of legal immigration is recognised.

My vote was "in favour" .
I have the impression that there are those in this House who appear to be frustrating this process of enlargement by placing unnecessary obstacles in the way and often using spurious arguments to limit the preparation for enlargement: for example, the rejection of the proposal to fill the 35 vacant posts in the language reserve between 2001 and 2002.



It refers to where we are now.
not that i would even know the gnome-specific way :)


While on this point, I should like to say that I am a little intrigued by questions put and remarks made by Members of this Parliament on monetary stability and monetary supply.
This text at least has the merit of exposing the outrageous untruth to which the supporters of a federal Europe resorted when they asked the French to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. At that time, the single currency was presented as a purely technical instrument to improve the operation of the economy in relation to the dollar and the yen, and as an operation that was perfectly neutral in terms of national sovereignty.
Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4?

We do not understand why the President-in-Office has allowed confusion to arise between his institutional position as President of the European Union and his role as spokesperson for the bilateral decisions of 14 Member States against one.

If additional information is necessary, this is also in the interests of the citizen, who is becoming increasingly involved in the process of monitoring Community law.
Unfortunately, the Greens did not nominate him again for the Bundestag, but he is right nonetheless, which is why we have tabled a motion stating that we should keep an eye on these risks but not totally ban genetic transfer.



I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.

In conclusion, a few words about the situation in Burma/Myanmar.


Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public.
But that is not the only factor adversely affecting the Stability Pact, it is also suffering from a lack of credibility on the part of the international organisations and also the European Union, which owing to a confusion of competences, wastage, and mismanagement, are displaying traits that would be dismissed as being typical of the Balkans, were it not for the fact that this is happening in our own organisations.


The margin of error is 2%.

The prices of shares in technology have risen in a such a way which cannot be justified economically.



Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days.

I should like to call this a 'Swedish paradox' .
man gstreamer sucks
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented, when and by whom.


We must, therefore, all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May.


This is, however, wrong because we know that the Member States themselves have contributed to the report which serves as a basis for the whole directive.


Let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings.



Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.




since the packages work fine for thousands of people

We are now paying the price for this permissiveness which some parties have been championing as the way of progress for over thirty years, but what progress do we see, except progress in the loneliness of our peers, the broken families and the children left to fend for themselves who, almost naturally, turn to drug addiction, sexual promiscuity, sects and alcoholism.

Madam President, my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment.

easy install
This would be cofunded under the common agricultural rural development programme.
We therefore propose an extensive public awareness campaign, with whatever programmes the Commission can suggest, and increasing awareness among the police, judicial and customs authorities.


The European Union and its Member States now provide 55% of total international aid and two thirds of global non-refundable aid.




Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.
Our main role in the European Parliament is therefore to exercise supervision.
rwabel: 'save current setup' at the top

By far the biggest is road transport.


Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland' s energy supply.


This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.


A new STOP programme is planned to start from this year and this will be open to accession countries.


Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.
Georgia is a long way away, it is true, and a few years ago, the Balkans seemed just as far away.

When that was achieved, I abstained from voting out of regard for this procedure, just as the majority of my group will do tomorrow at the final vote.
In April 1999, the draft budget submitted by the European Commission provided for a 50% reduction in that budget line!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are many reasons why, in principle, I welcome what the Commission has submitted: firstly, because the Commission is sending a signal to the Member States that they are not alone in the problems of migration, refugees and displaced persons; secondly, because it at least regulates in part the distribution of the burden; and, thirdly, because the Commission is proposing a differentiated package of responsibilities for two different groups, namely recognised refugees and displaced persons, i.e. persons temporarily seeking protection.

The ethnic divide is becoming entrenched, at the same time that an ungovernable protectorate is being set up which is seeking to deny the Kosovars independence without, for all that, being capable of applying the hypocritical framework of UN Resolution 1244.


Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.
My feeling, on the occasion of this debate, is that it is worth paying tribute to the actions of this great man of peace, this indefatigable pilgrim.
The European Union will continue to follow developments in that country in the light of these principles and will not fail to draw the necessary conclusions in the event that these principles are not adhered to.


The negotiations came up against stumbling blocks on several points.



That is why we try to help applicant countries to develop and implement health and safety policies.
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.
trukulo : Seems to come with almost anything that needs it


Currently, 18 countries participate in the Erasmus programme, including countries from Eastern and Central Europe.
I have taken note of your proposal.


The victims do not only require material aid, but also legal assistance - because we are generally talking about people with no documentation, with no options and who are living in fear and need help - which, at the same time, protects their identity and guarantees that they will not suffer even worse problems if they return to their countries of origin.
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.

Information on the fattening process and, where applicable, on antibiotics or other stimulants administered, as demanded in proposed Amendment No 48, have absolutely no business to be on the label.
Recommendation for second reading, in the form of a letter, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European and Council Decision on the application of aerial-survey and remote-sensing techniques to the agricultural statistics for 1999-2003 (13300/1/1999 - C5-0065/2000 - 1998/0296(COD))

An increasing number of natural disasters are clearly linked to the fact that we are placing ever greater demands on the global ecosphere and biosphere.
There is a huge difference between these two things.
The Member States will obviously not like this, but why could we not keep a scoreboard for this, just as we do for the Member States' performance rating in terms of implementing European legislation?


We must, at long last, opt for one levy principle, either in the country of residence or the country of employment.

They are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately.
Subject: Worsening situation in Kosovo In Kosovo, the genocide of Serbs and other non-Albanian ethnic groups is continuing and worsening to the extent that Mr Bernard Kouchner himself recently announced that the political situation and the level of security in the area were far from satisfactory.


We need to continue to demand that the safety of all citizens be guaranteed and that any form of ethnic division and provocation be penalised.
2005-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	kergan	bitchx is to dry for me
I would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards, because here we received conflicting answers in committee.
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.

However, I would like to strengthen one demand, and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years.
The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here.


However, at this stage these are just proposals.
The Commission is happy to adopt the report and the draft resolution.
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.
The effect on the lives of those people, their families and their entire region is traumatic and, let's face it, inhuman.
That is the advice I have been given in relation to cats.

Mr President, unforgivably, I have forgotten something.

Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.



I would like clarity on that point.

(The President gave Mr Alavanos the floor after he had clarified that his point related to Rule 37)


I would like to thank the Commission for its outstanding analysis of the situation.
It was a disgrace to this House that we had to tolerate such a bureaucratic administrative hold-up over the question as to whether or not we can send the rapporteur of Parliament 's Committee on Budgetary Control to Bosnia and Herzegovina.



With regard to the lives which have unfortunately been lost during the recent riots in Turkish prisons and the report on torture and abuse during the transport of prisoners, the European Union has raised the issue in bilateral contacts with Turkish authorities.



However, the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes.
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.

In particular, we will be looking for evidence that each new proposal has been properly tested against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and we will be looking for sector-specific debates in the European Parliament's own specialised committees.
For example, Luxembourg once refused to comply with the requests made by the judicial authority of another country because the act was not a crime under Luxemburgish law.
In this context I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what progress the other Member States have made.

I also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the Member States and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed.
We therefore welcome the Commission' s working document in principle, together with Ingo Schmitt' s report on the drawing up of a common policy on asylum and refugees, but we emphasise that it ought not to be the least generous countries which set the standards.
This structural change is pending, while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation.
Mr President, our prayers and sympathy go to the 118 sailors and their families.

The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.


A number of papers have been circulated to Members before this particular debate, and I would just like to highlight one from the rapporteur where he says that the only beneficiaries of the entry into force of the text proposed by the Council will be the chocolate multinationals.


try open nautilus


If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.



On the same subject, I would also like to say that I am taking great care that this social divide, as it has been called, this economic divide between the group of the richest regions and the group of the poorest regions is not exacerbated by another divide linked to the new economy - I am thinking of some extremely worrying figures relating to this subject - that I could call the digital divide, that is to say the democratic access of the most remote citizens, the poorest citizens, the most disadvantaged citizens, to the new technologies and to the opportunities provided by these new technologies.
My request is that an apology to Commissioner Reding be now made in writing on behalf of Parliament and I hope this is not an experience we see repeated.



The libertarian decriminalisation measures have proved to be inefficient and dangerous no matter what the field.
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.
The resulting ban on other phthalates had nothing whatsoever to do with children's toys or teething rings.

In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries.
As a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I can only hope that the Commission will be willing to change the way it runs the MEDA programme and the very structure of the programme, in the manner indicated by Mr Bourlanges, that is, basing its approach on radical streamlining of the cycle of procedures, greater recourse to macrofinancial support, and less complex commitology.
If you recall, the French President-in-Office of the Council had believed that following the first reading of the Council' s common position, all negotiations would come to an end, and we would have to accept the situation.

The issue in question is one which has to be settled on a legal basis.
However, I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you.
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.

Agrajag, ?

At least these would be proactive and could hopefully deal with some of the problems before they arise, which would make a pleasant change.


The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
This is the Commission' s first budget in the form of activity-based budgeting; in other words, all budget expenditure has been allocated to political areas.
ogra: much better looking
Furthermore, may I point out that in Question 36 there were three questions in one, which took up over 20 minutes.
There should be a broad consensus on this in this House.
hda1 exists , hda2 is a extended, does that mean #2 in the installer is tho correct?
I think it is a very competent piece of work, and I think some important improvements have been made to the common position.

The importance of innovation was stressed both at the Lisbon and Feira summits.

If we are to be able to achieve any kind of progress, it is genuinely necessary for the European Union to be closely coordinated internally, to cooperate closely with the United Nations and its General Secretary and to cooperate closely with the United States, which has been indefatigable in its attempts to solve this conflict.






Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data.


Well, the Commission has known that for a long time.
In particular I welcome the information it contains regarding the EU-China human rights dialogue.

The next forum is to be held in Stockholm in June.

The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.

This view was made plain in Council working groups and was reflected in the final draft Presidency Proposal, a draft that is supported by the vast majority of Member States.
This debate has been deferred once again, even though there is a great deal to be discussed.




It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.




The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].


We must convince people that enlargement will be politically and economically advantageous to both sides from the very outset.
This is the key to prevention.



I would like to praise the Portuguese Presidency, because they could have quite easily opted out, or it could have quite easily dragged on for a while longer, but they took the bull by the horns.



These combined outbreaks have cost the European budget billions.
Speaking today on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on the protection of human rights, both during and in the aftermath of war, I deeply regret finding myself in the difficult position of having to say that this Convention' s downfall has come about on the continent of Europe itself.
We need that oxygen, we need that horizon for the great European debate.



We must not monitor and prevent it.


Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.

Mr Sterckx rather feebly states in his present report that information on these situations must be made available to passengers.
We also have to take care to be sufficiently focused on poverty and doing something that really is to the benefit of the most disadvantaged groups.

Ultimately, we have had to take measures in order to stimulate the development of rail, railway licences and railway infrastructure by, among other things, opting for liberalisation in this case.
The impression has been given that only reproductive cloning is banned.
This is evident from the first and second Gulf War and another five years, the 1991-1996 period, during which Baghdad categorically refused to cooperate in the oil-for-food programme, which led to a completely unnecessary lengthening of human suffering.



This year we have heard in Ireland, as is obvious from the concern expressed by Irish colleagues here today, of the danger facing Father Brendan Forde, a Franciscan working in the small village of La Ùnion who has chosen to remain with his parishioners at considerable danger to his own life.





Mr President, I want first to thank Mrs Read and Parliament for the report, which has been produced extremely rapidly and is very important, because the extraordinary summit will take place next week and the e-Europe initiative is one of the fundamental documents there.
Nor, it seems, does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote.


It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.


This will not change a great deal in the short term.

In this regard, an appeal has been made to the Serbian authorities, calling upon them to bring their criminal inquiries to a close in order to punish those guilty of crimes, to put an end to the increasing suppression and to amend the recent law limiting the freedom of the media.
These are an estimated 175,000 to 190,000 refugees and displaced persons, and they are living in truly abject conditions.
We should use what we learn during such campaigns and share that knowledge with applicant countries, perhaps in the context of DAPHNE.

In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.
Paragraph 15 of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards Europe.

He even said that this stadium differs very little from a large number of stadia in England.

On the human rights situation in Chechnya I have the following comments. The Commission is also deeply concerned about increasing evidence of human rights abuses in Chechnya.

Indeed, it is our duty to be ambitious and to demand that all our young people are able to speak another language fluently, offering them bilingual education whenever possible.






The possibility of giving an explanation was raised, and I argued that that would mean a new vote.
Recent events have led to even greater lack of faith within Scotland in the decision-making processes and in the structure of the CFP itself.
However, I stand by this interpretation, which is linked both to the principle of the agenda and the principle of urgent matters.
I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives.
Second, where longer-term intervention is necessary, actions under the rapid reaction facility will anticipate operations under existing instruments, which can take over the action using the normal procedures.
Despite this, we need to ensure that goods and people arrive at their destinations faster, more efficiently, at cheaper rates and in cleaner conditions than before. Rail transport is not really a great help in this respect, quite the reverse, in fact.



However, it is a notoriously difficult area to enforce because of outside conditions, such as bad weather, that will affect the way fishermen operate.


If that is your idea of a united Europe, then that in itself is of great concern to me.
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.


Even the Nordic governments have supported a change for the worse that has now resulted in Member States not even needing to give reasons why they do not want the Commission to pass on documents that they themselves have given to the Commission.

If the legal basis is vague, we agree with the request for the Commission to take an initiative to make it clearer, and the Intergovernmental Conference must also take responsibility for this.
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.

Mr Bösch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs.
It is not just a question of agreeing to the controls and the levels but also a timetable for implementation that makes us happy and satisfied in this Parliament.
The lessons to be learned with regard to the present situation are that public health must be the prime consideration, that every potential risk must be anticipated, even if the cost is high, and that we must respect the right of a Member State to apply more stringent safeguards than its partners.
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Burg, and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Abu Ala.
In addition, the Commission is already in a position to announce that, under its programming of the assistance envelope of regional programmes for 2000, around EUR 2 m have been earmarked for projects within the field of justice and home affairs.

The response to previous recommendations by the NII was to ignore them.
When translating research results into catch restrictions, the Commission should not only take the advice of scientists, but also the fishermen. If not, imposing total allowed catches and quotas will meet with unnecessary resistance from them.

Nevertheless, we recognise that the experience in all Member Sates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified, as a temporary remedy, to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under-represented.
The sanctions constitute relentless lethal force, and innocent Iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price.

Schemes do exist, but, in the real world, before and during implementation, there are administrative obstacles to mobility, such as welfare cover, which discourage many researchers.


It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.
It is very important that the Council manages to further develop the progress already made in the reconciliation between the ethnic groups and that Resolution 1244 can be put into practice.
At this point, the Commission must table a proposal on how the data can be harmonised, or the whole exercise will be completely pointless.

It is unjustifiable that, in a number of countries, female circumcision is still practised and that we maintain the best relations with these countries as a matter of course.
I would like to remind you - and I am at liberty to say this here because I have also said this outside the Bureau - that I referred this point to the Bureau, to you and colleagues in the Bureau, and have, for the short term, suggested four possibilities for Fridays, before we decide on the agenda for the year 2001, because then we might just as well, of course, vote here in plenary.

It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.
Mr President, the only reason we voted for this report is to reaffirm that we are opposed on principle to any form of racism, xenophobia and oppression of minorities, within or outside the European Union.
Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads.

I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.

The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.
On the same day, the majority of MEPs voted in favour of the amended version of the fingerprinting system Eurodac, which further criminalises immigrants seeking to move to the European Union.

My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.

Moreover, such aid is often also misappropriated by the local administration.
All of this is currently being done and is part of our short-term work programme.

On 14 April 1999, the European Parliament endorsed an ECB recommendation on doubling its capital in the long term.



She would find it extremely useful and also a saving, but she will not be persuaded.





Round three to the anti-PPE alliance.
We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities. Instead we must get them out of this ghetto.
The concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace.
This depleted uranium has been used in Cumbria up to 1995, and it is believed that as many as 1400 depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Solway Firth, which is an inlet of the Irish Sea.
no prob
Nevertheless, the largest democracy in the world does have the greatest influence in the region and bears some humanitarian responsibility here.
However, the Commission can have an impact in developing a standard methodology to describe and record the extent of undeclared work and to assess its impact on the economy and on social solidarity.
We also know that the current agreement carries on from the 1976 agreement, and can be extended according to future needs.
And it is certainly not the present structure.

I would only say that since that is nearly 20% of the total number of appointments, we are on target for this year' s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20% advance in the number of women who are appointed.

I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.
If this fails, then opponents of the joint development policy are bound to press for abolition full stop.
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.

This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.
2005-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	Crane	I will when I get home


Mrs Pack, you will understand that it is not for the President to comment on these observations.

What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission's proposals?
I should also like to commend to the House Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7, also in their names, which strengthen and underline important points in the report.
I believe that the relinquishment of power in certain respects will be inevitable to remove the final barriers to the internal market as soon as possible.
I naturally hope that the free movement of people who have the misfortune to be HIV-positive is not restricted in any way on grounds of public health.
It is therefore the intention of our political group, as the amendments that have been presented have highlighted, to ensure that the networks are compatible with sustainable development and that the reform corresponds to the objective of uniting the whole Community by prioritising the remote regions, which have hitherto been neglected. Finally, it is our intention to upgrade the railways and to bring about the decentralisation of the networks, particularly with regard to airports and ports.


For example, what she says on kerosene seems to me to be a reasonable way of presenting this problem, which undoubtedly cannot be solved at European level, but at world-wide level and by the ICAO.
In bilateral negotiations, each party tries to focus on the areas where he is least competitive, since it is understood that the rest will be left to the others.


Besides, medication cannot be distributed like sacks of rice.



We have examined these responses, and have found the majority of them satisfactory, as is recorded.
But politically and geo-politically, the fundamental weight has essentially lain with the United States, its powerful neighbour to the North.

As the presidency mentioned, it is true that the participation of Mr Solana in Sharm el-Sheikh and the committee of enquiry, and the presence of the European Union in Taba through its permanent representative, Ambassador Moratinos, have enabled us to make effective contributions to the peace process.
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.

Madam President, we would accept this proposal.

The illegal bombing by the US and Britain, which is not covered by any UN Security Council resolution, has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous: it should not be allowed to continue.

That is a considerable challenge and one which makes no sense unless we understand what is really at stake in this issue. It has been a source of conflict for at least a decade, both at the trading level - between the operators - and at the institutional and international level.

The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.





But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union.


It is also very important in the light of our forthcoming enlargement to the East that we should emphasise that the European Union does not operate a two-speed environmental policy and that those Member States to which exceptions apply must make every effort to move towards compliance with EU requirements and must furnish proof of progress in this direction.
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.

2005-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	bob2	no

The Commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counter-productive rigidity, and also because it would breach Staff Regulations.
Ms Mann and Mr Ferrer, referred in particular to Amendment No 5.

Moreover, the original impression came from the description of the conditions for triggering the Facility, which, being very general, still does not give a practical idea of them, when it would have been enough, without prejudice to the normal intervention conditions laid down by Community regulations, to highlight those conditions which, on the basis of their urgency, trigger the Reaction Mechanism.
xskoulax, didnt forget, thx though

My opinion is that we should start by differentiating between compensation and subsidies.
If this is adopted, there is a risk that rail safety will be jeopardised.

Therefore, the resulting specific proposals will be presented during the subsequent months and we hope that the specific proposals will be under way by the next European Council in the Spring, under the Swedish Presidency.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, if you would like to present your oral amendment, Parliament will decide.
We have attached particular importance to the inclusion of dealers in precious stones, dealers in luxury goods with a value in excess of EUR 50 000 and auctioneers.

This is not an option for us any more.

That is why it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament, for the institutions, the Commission and the Council, to make decisions here so that we have a new effective instrument with which to combat money laundering.
We see that the wealthiest states within the European Union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid.
The only selection criteria we need - although I fear this will be difficult, given the nature of the debate thus far - is to identify the operations which would be most effective precisely because they are simple to implement.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr Hänsch, if my information is correct, and I have not had a chance to talk to you about this, but I say this with all due respect to our former President, Klaus Hänsch, then our former President specifically made the same point in relation to the Tapie case, that is to say that we should await the outcome of the appeal procedure before we reach a decision here.

Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.

The air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect.

In my view this is necessary for consumer confidence, which is a fickle thing, but others, probably the majority in my group, will support Amendment Nos 1 and 2 which they believe clear up all legal uncertainty.
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.



Ecosystem surveillance promises to be a multidisciplinary activity. If atmospheric pollution has lost something of its extremely topical nature in the face of these priorities, it may be consistently integrated into the list of planet-wide challenges.

We are therefore in favour of both fisheries agreements, which we hope may continue in the future, and we are anxious, Commissioner, to be able soon to hold a debate in our Fisheries Committee, and to repeat what we are saying now, in relation to the extremely important fisheries agreement with Morocco.


I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.

yes, I remembered about daniels as soon as I hit enter :-/

The final point I would like to make relates to the transport dossier.



This is about calling on the administration to present an action plan by 15 May describing exactly how improvements can be made.
Both sides of this conflict are violating agreements.
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.

Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing.
The Portuguese Presidency will organise a Social Affairs Council which we can engage with if we deliver a view.
But there still remains a very great deal to be done.
Nobody can deny the fact that this presence contributed to reducing tensions and to restoring a climate, which was as conducive as possible, in such a highly sensitive context, to the free expression of the whole population' s right to vote.

Both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure, which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year.
We will certainly need energy and patience.

Mr President, Commissioner, I think we are all convinced that we have an obligation and a duty to protect the environment and contribute to sustainable development with an environmental policy that has seen its importance increased subsequent to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
With regard to Montenegro, I must say that we certainly welcome the democratic way in which the most recent municipal elections in Podgorica and Herceg Novi have been conducted.


It should be clear that, ideally, the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation.
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction.


yann__: www.ubuntulinux.nl and www.ubuntu-linux.nl (run by the same guy, need to be integrated)



It might have been wiser for the report to have set a fixed and reasonable deadline for this body to be established, which would give more force to the proposal put forward by the rapporteur and the European Parliament.

For this reason, we consider it appropriate and necessary to show our solidarity and support for the democratic régime in Paraguay and to reject coups d' état and support democracy.

Fundamental rights are of secondary importance in treaties these days.
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.

I am consequently obliged to confine myself to a few brief and far from comprehensive comments.



I feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored.

This will be a very important tool.
Madam President, in my group' s opinion, the European Union today faces a political and ethical challenge which is without precedent since the creation of the Union.

Our motion for a resolution is enormously important for the people of Europe and above all for the Czech public.
We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power.
We should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management.



For the time being, it is enough to propose that the seats in the European Parliament should be allotted on the basis of a degressive proportional system, with a minimum number of seats per Member State, while of course respecting Article 190 of the Treaty.
From Lisbon in 1992 to Cannes in 1995, and especially in Barcelona that same year, there have always been requests for a strong Euro-Mediterranean Partnership to be established.


Her strength and power for evil purposes is matched only by her determination not to find the missing prisoners.
Mr Swoboda is right in stating that years of lack of investment in capacity, infrastructure and technology must now be rectified.
When Mrs Attwooll and others ask if we can have derogations for countries which are already that good and if they must still remove the spinal column, then I call on you, Mr Byrne, to table a proper list of derogations to the Council saying countries A, B, C and D comply and are exempt from certain measures.

We seem to keep forgetting that the Chechen government was elected under the supervision of the OSCE and that we also need to intercede for this legitimate Chechen government, except that we cannot find this government today, because its representatives are holed up in the mountains fighting for their very survival.
Mr President, more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in Venezuela.


We shall support this report which the rapporteur is clearly against.
This is only right, because it is a sound report, on which I would like to congratulate him.
If we want to make absolutely certain of the success of institutional reform, i.e. the IGC and the related Treaty of Nice, it is because we want enlargement to go ahead as speedily as possible.
In short, I think we have done the bulk of the work.


- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.
Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle.


isn't there a bot in here?

If you donlt see why Linux is a superior platform, you haven;t looked hard enough.

I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.
However, the proposal for a directive is not without its controversial aspects, particularly in so far as it undermines professional secrecy in certain sectors, notably the legal profession, whilst failing to impose a corresponding obligation to declare suspicious activities relating to high-value business transactions on professionals such as those selling luxury items, auctioneers, customs officials and so on.

Even if it is not prescribed under law, it could of course simplify a number of operations, not only for the Commission, but also for the Court of Auditors or OLAF.
This is not one such area.


We must therefore reflect upon whether hormone use accords with the basic ethical rules we human beings have.

Duff and Voggenhuber, on the other hand, think of themselves as true European Parliamentarians whose task it is to further the interests of Europe as a whole.

This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.
My second point is that Mr Oostlander is perfectly within his rights to say that, under Rule 115, proceeding with the debate or the vote can be questioned as the documentation was not available 24 hours in advance.
Do you yourself not think that this is a little peculiar?
I know that there are a number of honourable Members in this House who have done the same job for their own countries.

Mr Dell' Alba, with regard to the first part of your intervention, we are indeed in the throes of internal reform of this House.

With regard to the comment that Mr Korakas' question was not a new one, I must say that Turkey' s application for accession to the European Union subjects it to closer scrutiny of its responsibilities in complying with the basic criteria for accession. I believe that the Turkish authorities are well aware of this.

I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.
As I have already said, we are talking about 14 countries.
There is widespread agreement as to the fact that Plan Colombia and these pronouncedly military components pose a threat to the peace negotiations now under way, and will engender an escalation of the conflict in Colombia after more than three decades of civil war, over 300 000 dead, and when we had hoped that it would be possible to engage in dialogue once President Pastrana took office, and resolve the country' s problems, i.e. the conflict.

We call on the Commission to use its influence and to take its own action to form a similar association for gas transmission system operators so that results similar to those achieved in Florence can be achieved in Madrid in the parallel process for the gas sector.
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.

Madam President, with rather more levity.

If not all the information required by Community regulations is available, it is vital that a specific label is attached to the product clearly indicating its non-EC origin.
I have been concerned by the lack of the involvement of the civil society in the issues that you talk about, particularly in relation to trade.
- (SV) At the Council' s meeting in Cologne, it was decided that an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should be prepared.

For all the above reasons, we believe that the 'joint' resolution in question demonstrates most dramatically how urgent it is for people to organise joint resistance and their opposition to this criminal policy, and to take the initiative and act.
What about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment, victimisation and discrimination?



What is being done now is a step in the right direction.
anir: erm, I think you should read wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats again and make sure you followedthe instructions correctly
His strategy is very much akin to that of his godfather, Charles Taylor, in neighbouring Liberia, who, by means of terror, forces the population to vote for him in the forthcoming presidential elections and establishes a new Mafia state in the heart of Africa' s diamond industry.

We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.
Our group supports the former position expressed by Parliament, according to which the Council must agree to amend the financial perspectives, particularly with regard to Category 4.
I therefore ask that a resolution be taken in connection with the oral question.
rhodan, ubuntu is released every 6 months, with feature additions in the beginning (=breakage, like X.Org was a few days ago), but later on it will stabilize
The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives.








In order to obtain a visa, they have to travel back to Tiflis.
pitti: sorry its a bit hard to report better, as its not finishing init


For the nationals of a country, society makes progress slowly, but it does make progress, witness the PACS vote in France, but the notion of the family in the case of immigrants is inflexible.
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.
If a proposal is no longer within the confines of the Commission, then the latter ought not to be able to refuse to let us see it.
We are asking African countries to accord women a larger place in society, but we ought to begin by establishing parity in our own countries.
The obligation upon States to proceed against war criminals is established in the Geneva Conventions, but that is clearly not enough.

However, neither the European Union as such nor the Council has any competence or direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the territory and the protection of the individual interests of undertakings in the region. These elements are, on the one hand, the responsibility of the United Nations, as the administrator of the territory, and on the other, of the governments of each Member State which may act to protect these undertakings.
What immediate action does the Commission intend to take in order to expedite such an agreement?

We have withdrawn our signatures after all. In our opinion, the text we submitted originally would have formed a much better base for a discussion.

If enlargement is to be implemented successfully, certain institutional changes are required.

The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.
billy gives the consumers crap and they close their eyes and swallow it
It is important that we ensure that it can do its work effectively.
Mr President, I too should also like to express my great concern at the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia, a concern that is actively shared by all friends of that country.

yeah i understood that && means "and"

As you know, the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue, green and red sections of the political spectrum.
Quantitatively, because it affects several million people and qualitatively, because the very existence of this extremely diversified people is at stake.

Mr President, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, as I said, these proposals for legislation have been presented by means of Commission initiatives. The Commission, by using the information provided by its various committees, can, of course, take into account the opinions expressed by various interest groups, and in particular those which legitimately oppose discrimination.

We all accept that there must be a redistribution of the best land in Zimbabwe, but this must be done through round table negotiations, and not with the violent acts we have seen over the last few months.

Bhutan criticises Nepal on the grounds that its constant changes of government make it incapable of action.

I would like, without reservation, to thank the House - to thank this part of the budgetary authority - and also to thank the Council for their assistance in ensuring that we could make that cash facility available before Christmas.



The subtitle of the e-Europe initiative, "An Information Society for All" , or we could also say as Mr Seppänen has said here, "A Knowledge-based Society for All" , is an indication of the far-reaching objectives of this initiative.

Secondly, the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive.

Would it indeed not be preferable to harmonise the compensation or the way in which the costs will be met, at the time that all tests need to be carried out, in advance rather than afterwards, thus ruling out any distortion of competition?


This represents a major effort by the Member States to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability.

Indeed, above all, safety first should be our guiding rule, and I am sure it will be our guiding principle in the months to come.
The proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out a strict and transparent framework, thus responding fully to consumer concerns.
I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure.


I believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the Commission will produce.
(Parliament adopted the two decisions and the resolution in successive votes)
Women are explicitly included as a target group for support.
We need to think very carefully about how we are going to proceed in this matter.





Lastly, I should like to congratulate Baroness Ludford on her report and let her know that we intend to seriously examine its proposals.
Thank you, Mr Wynn, I cannot answer you right now, but I will have the matter investigated.

As for President Clinton, he is more resolved than ever to use all his influence and the influence of his country to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion before the end of his term of office, i.e. by the end of the year.

Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.

I therefore expect you, Mr President, to accord me the respect of the House and the answer to my question.
where does it display the fps

On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.
I tell you this though; a fraction of these practical regulations would do the citizens and workers of the Member States a greater service than reams and reams of fancy talk and great ideologies.
We are delighted that there was an almost unanimous consensus, however, on the new practical approach to the general discharge.
This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate.


More importantly, I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder.
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.



Vital tools for achieving this are suffrage for newcomers, humane treatment of political refugees, equal treatment of all residents of the European Union, irrespective of their nationality, and the reversal of the burden of proof in legal cases.
I should like to extend my warmest thanks to both him and Mr Virrankoski for the supplementary budget, which applies mainly to Parliament and the Council.

The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.
I would urge Mrs Peijs to read again the latest version of the Treaty with regard to what she considers to be the last word on the law on competition within the European Union.
Nevertheless, I do not intend today to deal with the aspects on which we agree - you know these from the communication - but I would like to expand a little more on the reasons for the two points of disagreement.
Sweden' s membership of the EU means that Sweden, too, was informed about the common school milk programme and, today, Sweden consumes approximately one tenth of the common budget for school milk.





Was it right to do this off its own bat, without checking what the other Member States thought?
East, and especially south, of the EU' s borders, an increasing majority of people live in a sea of social destitution and political oppression, and it is that which triggers the asylum problem.

The best solution to violence is to persevere with peaceful efforts to achieve democracy, negotiating with and dismantling the paramilitary networks linked to the army and to the state apparatus.
To act effectively we need to establish voluntary cooperation, with variable geometry, where Member States of the Union with an interest in this or that action would participate - and there is no reason why non-member states should not participate too, where appropriate.
I know that the first part of the report follows the interim report which the honourable Member made, and is an account of the violence and intimidation which sadly marked the early stages of the election campaign.

Regarding, in particular, the health and safety of workers, we are now governed by the terms of a directive dating from 1989.



The Member States must overcome their perhaps justified anxiety as regards the management of their airspace and, at some point, must take a longer-term view of newly-emerging needs which goes beyond their borders and beyond the present situation.
This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry.
smurfix: that in jap or chineese?

In dealing in depth with the issue of the right to live as a family, and in defining the precise conditions for its application, the text enables us to hold a real debate.
They could be our fathers, our sons or ourselves.


Environmental damage has harmful effects on public health.

It does not flinch from using violence in these activities.
Researchers throughout the world have said that Parkinson' s disease and other serious illnesses can perfectly well be cured by other methods.
I believe that if Mr Cohn-Bendit, for example, wishes for a full debate on this question, he should support our proposal so that we can include it in the next agenda.
This ensures that monetary policy makes its full contribution to overall economic welfare while also providing an environment in which the new economy, should one emerge, will be able to flourish.

It was a very interesting debate and there were two dimensions. The first is the political one and the second is the technical one.
This argument is therefore not relevant.
This is precisely why I understand and support the issue raised by the Chairman of our Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela Suanzes­Carpegna.

thanks guys


The question on quite a few people' s lips is: what is to become of this report?


I would like to thank you in advance for your efforts and for the endeavours of Parliament and the European Commission to protect freedom and respect for the rights of the defence in the trial of these thirteen Iranian Jews.

We therefore move the inadmissibility of this report which, in addition to having a dubious legal basis, was not properly prepared and does not enjoy the broad consensus which Europe must have.
That means that we want to have an effective system.




As is so often the case, there is a lack of documentation for comparing figures and data between the protocols, although in this case we should thank the European Commission for including the minutes of the negotiations, in the case of Guinea, which makes more data available and ultimately makes the process more transparent. This is welcome and the European Parliament is grateful for it.

It is important that we fulfil the commitment to double the number of female appointments.



To this end, you, President Prodi, and you Commissioner, and all of us, must stop getting bogged down in bureaucratic detail and doubts.
From the point of view of the institutions, the current impasse is certainly extremely serious.
The Community' s level of self-sufficiency in this area is between 50 and 60%.




That was already mentioned in the debate and I appreciate that very much.
When, in future, production rights are changed, I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers.
Ladies and gentlemen of the European Union, if no genuine redistribution of land is carried out in Columbia, even European Union aid will end up lining the pockets of the drug traffickers, of the large land owners and multinationals.

Nobody should have to tolerate competitors on their infrastructure that refuse or are unable to grant the same access at home.


Adoption of the Commission' s proposal and of Mr Davies's report will mean a considerable improvement in air quality for Europe's citizens.


We will examine questions to the Commission.




Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.


As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.
- (FR) I could not vote for the report by Baroness Ludford and I want my abstention to be perceived as an expression of strong contempt, because of the incongruities and exaggerations contained in certain passages of this report.


It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.



Finally, we reached general agreement in the committee on a large number of amendments.

Who is in favour of entering Zimbabwe as the fifth sub-item in the Human Rights section?

The majority of nut production in the European Union takes place in arid areas and on steep slopes in drought conditions.
According to our Group, it is of paramount importance that this Charter be included in the Treaty.


That is why it is so important that the EU Member States join forces and want to work together on future-orientated education, each according to their own tradition but, let there be no mistake, with a common goal in mind.
Finally, we shall be convening the European Conference twice, once in Sochaux on 23 November for the ministers of European affairs of the Fifteen and ministers from the candidate countries, and once in Nice on 7 December for the Heads of State and Government, at the opening of the Biarritz Summit.

I agree with a number of the contributions here.
That is what we wish to bear in mind, irrespective of the fact that, otherwise, we are, of course, always happy to integrate transport policy into other policy areas and environmental policy into transport.
There is the need for good governance and support for democracy.


Everyone agrees on the idea that children are the future of the world but, at the same time, they represent one of the most vulnerable groups in the population of this planet.
There is no way of enforcing the law.
As far as preparing for new languages is concerned, if you read the Cot report, called for by the honourable Member of your group, Mr Elles, you will see that we shall have an additional 460 language combinations in the future.
It is unfortunate that it does not want to study the report properly and that it does not respect the European Parliament's point of view by at least doing something.
Which comes first: children's health or the vested interests of industry?

2 windows?
This new definition goes on to say that this name is now used to designate a black, brown or white product, or one of any other colour, made with vegetable or industrial fats, or in fact anything else provided that the end result finds a market and preferably a world one at that.

I know that the outcome of this was thought to be unpleasant.

But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.

One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters.
Help from the European Parliament in this respect would be most welcome.


And what do we do if we are put under pressure soon to apply the research findings in the pharmaceutical field, or to clone for reproductive purposes?
Thank you, if there is, in fact, anything to say thank-you for.
I hope that the European Commission has the courage to go into the conciliation process arm in arm with the Parliament against, and it will be against, the Council.


I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard.

We are not terribly proud of the final result, but I should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found.



We have only succeeded in combating the Front National effectively in France because we never had any government alliance.
Firstly, it was agreed that all railway undertakings should definitively be granted rights of access to the entire rail networks of all Member States for international freight transport, by 2008 at the latest.

These proposals are not new but they are becoming more topical.
I would therefore like to ask the following question: Could the President-in-Office of the Council, here before Parliament, give a clear statement as to whether the Swedish Presidency is for or against the introduction of a Tobin tax?

The European Parliament cannot possibly support cutting development aid to South Africa by ten per cent.

War criminals will no longer be able to hide behind the borders of sovereignty.


It is commonly known that tariff reductions all too often only benefit large industrial users.



We hope that a better agreement will successfully be reached regarding the provision of information as an integral part of the discharge procedure.


One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe.

On the basis of the above considerations, I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to incorporate the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2.
This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise.

First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.



I would like to know if the Commission is making these threats and, if it is, whether it feels that it has an entitlement to do so.
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.
Point three: democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities.
However, I also realise that it is necessary to have cuts in order to ensure that we have sufficient resources for this generation and, indeed, future generations.
So as to make it absolutely clear: wood is an industrial commodity under Community law and it stands to reason that export aid, of the kind for which provision is made in agriculture, for example, should not be permitted under any circumstances where the export of wood is concerned.

Very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the Atlantic where the regional organisation is ICAT.
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.
This agenda is, of course, too restricted.

For us too, it is a new experience to be discussing matters of security and defence policy in this way.
It is not about creating hub economies which will make Europeans more prosperous: it is about working in partnership with Mediterranean countries in a partnership of values as well as trade, for the good of people to the south of the Mediterranean as well as those of us in Europe.
It is almost as if the project was a wonderful, beautifully-wrapped box of chocolates, but inside was absolutely packed with worms.


The Structural Funds can be used for restoration after natural disasters and advantage has been taken of this possibility in recent years.

So we are working within this framework and not outside it.
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.





In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.


It is important that we approach this debate with a very clear distinction between asylum and illegal immigration.


In addition, the Commission at this stage lacks the necessary resources for proper industrial cooperation.




For this reason, the Commission proposed yesterday that the financial perspective be revised and that there should be substantial use of agricultural appropriations for external action.
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.

The report insists on the need to reform the European Union' s administrative system, which is essential if there is to be efficiency, responsibility and transparency.
I have dealt with that point earlier in my remarks.
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.







Mr President, Commissioner, metaphorically-speaking, what we have in the new I+C technologies is new fuel for our economic locomotive to re-heat our eco-system.

Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
Either a standard is safe or it is not.
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts


Firstly, on account of the principle of equality, according to which all Members must be able to carry out their work under the same conditions.
This is in keeping with the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee.

The people making those complaints were very often justified in doing so - not always - but very often.
In many cases, this is a consequence of the application of fundamentalist laws or the carrying-out of ancestral practices and traditions.


Blackwell nope, but then again, just because you're not allergic, doesn't mean you're the first to run and participate ~_^
Is everything to be run on market principles, on private-sector principles?





If we want to do this properly, we will have our hands full.

The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals.
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.

Yet the concept of an SME continues to apply to a catch-all category embracing a wide range of company structures and situations.
While adding my thanks to the Council for the earlier answer, I would like to press the Council on a related matter.
Although our observers noted that the degree of violence, irregularities and intimidation in the period leading up to the elections meant that the words 'free and honest' could not be applied to the fifth legislative elections in the history of Zimbabwe, they nevertheless emphasised the efficient organisation of the voting itself, the large turnout - I believe it was the largest since independence was achieved - and the peaceful atmosphere in which it took place.
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.
In the light of the speed of developments, neither industry nor consumers benefit from such delays.


For far too long we have been telling women that they have to be better than the men they are competing against.
However, Mr President, I think there is another, more important issue that we must tackle without delay.

I am convinced that it is vital to introduce local NGOs in order to improve the quality of the programmes but also to raise the awareness of the Stability Pact, and the exact plans, in that region.


In quite a few lines, no payments whatsoever have been earmarked for the commitments for 2001.
Each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment.
Finally, this report, just like many others relating to immigration management, is unrealistic and highly populist.
They belong in the legislative text.

I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated.


The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, having been asked to give its opinion on this subject, did not wish to focus on aspects which fell within the remits of other committees.
Fourthly, the need for a change to Community customs legislation in order to ensure that the securities which guarantee the right to credit should also guarantee the automatic payments made by the customs offices after release of goods.
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.
However, I would stress that these remarks are out of place in a report on human rights.
That is why we are presenting this proposal, which is really a maintenance proposal, and what we are saying to the Commission is that, without further delay, proposals must be drawn up at the latest for the 2000-2003 period to achieve an improvement in this system without decreasing aid.


Allegations of torture and ill treatment of prisoners during their transfer after the operations should also be investigated.

Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health.

The Commission considers that the Member States have a crucial role to play in providing their expertise and human resources in supporting specialised projects in the fight against various criminal activities in the Balkan region, including the fight against corruption.

Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued.
Well that puts the friendship between Denmark and Bavaria back on terra firma.

I havent made the switch yet



As you ought to know, the extreme right gets into power only by exploiting and stressing our weaknesses, the areas we neglect.

Thirdly, for how long a period will the ECB be prepared to support the krone?
I would also like to thank the Portuguese presidency for its skilful handling of this very complex dossier - an example of Europeans working together to solve common problems.
The cost of Internet access, the sidelining of entire sectors of society (the young unemployed, housewives, the elderly) and the shortcomings in education and vocational training are serious obstacles to an information society meant to benefit everyone.

That concludes the explanations of vote.
At the same time, allowing up to 5% vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to be used in chocolate production sets a dangerous precedent, given that, in the long term, it may lead not just to the use of a higher percentage of these fats than set at present, but it may also open the way to chocolate being produced with other kinds of fat in future, including even genetically modified fats.
In an information context such as this, it is important to have access to the documents and draw one' s own conclusions, as the documents do not always spell things out clearly either.
The prospects for the years 2000 and 2001 are encouraging, with growth forecasts of over 3%. This will reinforce social links, increase solidarity and equal opportunities and, in particular, eliminate the inevitability of the mass unemployment which we have been enduring for too long.
Returning from Finland, where I witnessed precisely this kind of intensive cultivation, which it is absolutely crucial to the paper industry to promote, I nevertheless think, Mr Seppänen, that the wealth of Europe resides specifically in its diversity.


Fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this.
I want to assure Parliament that we will consider its recommendations very carefully.
As the rapporteur has already explained, the Commission already has this power for cereals, sugar, rice and eggs.
The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament initiated their direct political dialogue in 1981 and over the years this dialogue has encompassed a broad range of issues.
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	Why is that?

Far more resources are lost through an ineffective and unmotivated administration.
We are not looking for confrontation, we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together.
The presidency also intends to complete work on the peace and stability charter.




My second criticism follows on from the first.


However, I should like to stress that careful evaluation of a centralised procedure would be done in the Commission report required under Article 30 of the directive.

Commissioner, this debate is going to go on until we have completed the conciliation process.
Mr President, there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence.
Amendment No 34 calls for fair trade bananas to be supported regardless of their country of origin.

The Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that there is just one solution if we want to halt this risk: for each Member State to retain financial responsibility for the reception of refugees, and for European solidarity to be kept only for exceptional tragic circumstances.
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.
Yesterday we discussed the Lisbon Summit for the economic and social revival of Europe.

In a report by the United Nations, it is stressed that trafficking in people is one of the fastest growing forms of organised crime.

One is a bad choice and that is to adopt a short-term fix and cut taxes, abdicate our government responsibilities.
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto. However, it has now achieved notoriety.

It is true that the era of monopolies is past and that the Commission has initiated a process of liberalisation, of introducing competition into some public sectors in order to modernise them and improve their efficiency.


We ourselves are tabling a few amendments, which we ask you to support.
I therefore call upon the Members to support this point when we vote on the topical and urgent subjects, for this will allow Parliament to express an opinion as it has a duty to do.

I have had the opportunity to work with the rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and it has been an honour for me to chair the committee that voted for Mrs Echerer' s excellent opinion.

If we supplement the MacCormick report in this direction, the European Parliament will have done a good job in the eyes of the consumer.
Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations?
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.
It was not the President, but the Commission whom we asked for a statement.
Austrians working abroad had their cars vandalised, stones thrown at their houses and their children were threatened at school.


Therefore, Madam President, I believe, given that there is no possibility of making sufficiently quick progress with parliamentary procedures, that this House should trust you to intervene on our behalf in order to put an end to this situation and to make the Tunisian Government see sense.
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.
At this point I should like to support the call for more authority to be given to the merely advisory voice of the social partners in the sectoral committee and for the European social partners to be granted equal decision-making powers similar to those in many national regulations, when resolutions are passed.

I do not know when they will be available, but if it were to be before tomorrow then - in accordance with our agenda - the vote would have to be taken as early as tomorrow at noon!
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.
But I wanted to ask him whether he does not think the same problem could arise with the part of the first sentence of Amendment 54 that has not been changed and which, in the English version I have before me, reads: "stresses that the EU must collect reliable ethnic data as a basis for review" . I am concerned specifically with the terms "reliable ethnic data" and wonder whether Mr Sylla could perhaps table an oral amendment relating to this notion of "ethnic data" ?


UNEP has been working for some time on a report on the toxicological and radiological consequences of the use of depleted uranium in the Balkans.

Our group has also supported it. So that the debate may be held in an ordered fashion, which is what most concerns me, because this issue could distort the four important fisheries debates which we have on the agenda, it would be normal for this statement to be made after that debate, and that would then give us time to continue discussing this issue, although it seems that that will not be possible.
Will there be incentives and penalties from now on in order to ensure that the Community Support Framework is applied correctly to those who need it?
lostmonk, not really
In the longer term, we could look at other ways of supporting civil society and I should certainly be prepared to consider any concrete proposals which Parliament may put forward.
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.
However, the endless recitals and paragraphs in the documents before us do raise expectations among our partners, expectations which we cannot possibly fulfil, because we also have other responsibilities.





In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure, let me point out the following: this year, given the fluctuations in the exchange rates, we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less, assuming a parity euro-dollar rate.

(SV) Regarding the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre, we would state the following. As liberals, we believe that agricultural policy should be adjusted to the market and de-bureaucratised.

This whole absurd process, which has been going on now for 14 months, is not having any positive effects for one simple reason: because in certain sectors in the Union it is generating a rejection of the European Union itself.
For these and other reasons, Europe's citizens rightly expect the Community to support actions to conserve and sustainably manage tropical forests.


If we really want to prevent trafficking in women, we will need to adopt a different approach.
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: home again ?
To enable the ECB to be a party to agreements such as those known as the Plaza or Louvre agreements, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs felt it was clearly necessary to advise Parliament to vote for the recommendation.

There is here a potential which can only be realised fully at European level, in collaboration with universities, centres of excellence and the authorities.

Nevertheless, it is also the case, in my opinion, that Barak and the right-thinking political and social sectors in Israel could lose the excellent opportunity to negotiate with a leader such as President Arafat if they do not fulfil the minimum necessary requirements.

Greece has made a great many gestures of good will and good neighbourliness, a great many.
I still envisage that publication of forecasts will commence towards the end of 2000, in line with the statement I made last September at the European Parliament's plenary session on the previous ECB annual report.
As the report points out, we really must express "horror at the entry into Government in Austria of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party" .
Thus, its diplomatic presence in the world, both that of the Fifteen and of the Commission, is unique both in terms of staff numbers and geographical coverage.
What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain?
Just in order to concentrate the minds of the Member States, can we ask what the Commission, and indeed the SVC, have concluded as a result of the tests which have been carried out in Switzerland with regard to the number of animals, either by number or proportion, which have entered the human food chain?

It does not help matters though, Mrs Schroedter and also Mr Schulz, to want to concentrate on tackling this problem in the new German Länder, singling these regions out for attention.

He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey.
The first area is prudential rules for pension funds, and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage.
Mr President, it is certainly not a coincidence that so many Belgian Members have taken the floor during this debate today.
As I said, I understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck. The French language captures this sentiment rather beautifully with the expression: on ne peut pas contenter tout le monde et sa belle-mère [You can' t please all of the people all of the time].

The scheme also makes provision, according to a person' s age and service affiliation, for 60-70% of their salary to be counted as early retirement money.
It can also accept amendments which would bring forward the review of the directive and widen the scope of that review.

I'm experiencing some troubles with a fresh installed Warty version on a Dell Dimension (8300): The grub boot loader hangs during the boot process: I just get some "GRUB, GRUB, ..." on the upper left corner. Any suggestions? Thanks.
Bearing in mind the request made by the local authorities, Bosnia-Herzegovina was sent a guide whose use will help towards preparing a viability study on negotiations for an agreement of the same type.
mdke: learning and listening a lot

The KLA' s criminal activity must be brought to an end.
First of all, market players could be confused and find it difficult to appreciate the reasons for these changes.

As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.

crimsun:..indeed they dont..well i want to solve problems with the computer.. not create.. right..

This was a welcome report which Parliament had waited many years for, and which we hope to see more of.

Those of us who have seen so much suffering want to try to reach a peaceful and lasting situation.
Are these people, as discredited as they are, going to be able to restore the confidence that we need?
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.

It is about being able to compete with other superpowers.
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.
Both large and small companies will have to adapt and change over their accounts and computer systems to the new currency, which will involve substantial preparatory work.
Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in the debate and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work.




They should also speedily implement action programmes and specific measures in the context of a lifelong education and training strategy.
We shall see how much arbitration is required, but the French Presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue, given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the European Union' s institutions.
I am sure that the joint text represents a good balance between the need to guarantee a high level of environmental protection and the legitimate concerns of the various participants.
Parliament's success in introducing substantial changes in the original proposal is important.

The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern.

Of that, 15% are in gold, while the remaining 85% consist of US dollars and yen.
mIRC is now the only app on my system
As a Portuguese national and a European, no one more than I hopes that this summit will achieve positive results which can take Europe forward and show the merit of the rotating presidency, whatever the demographic and economic weight of each country.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by very sincerely thanking Mr Pesälä for his statement, but I must say straight away that the thrust of my comments is somewhat different.

For example, what use is the right to freedom of expression to someone who, owing to poverty and unemployment, suffers complete social exclusion?

We also unreservedly support the Commission's position on this issue.

The European 'Youth' initiative is a first step in that direction, and bears witness to a growing awareness of young people in the EU institutions.
If we were to raise this threshold we would be excluding companies where, due to their size, we cannot suppose that the aid does not affect trade between Member States.
Mr President, I also agree with the rapporteur with regard to the basic matters and I can naturally and gladly sympathise with the amendment calling for the transition period to be just two years.

In my opinion, Europe has today taken a step forward in its approach to the world of sport.
If, for example, the enlargement of the European Union encompasses countries such as Poland, which have large agricultural areas and a high proportion of their population working in agriculture, most of whom will become unemployed over the next 10 or 20 years as these countries engage in intensive farming, then there is room for manoeuvre here.

In particular, the scope of this proposal goes far further than previous directives and brings into its legislative fold a great many processes which require separate legislation, and need to be separately regulated because they are inherently different from the simple process of combustion.





So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage, be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme.
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.
I therefore once again promise to provide all the information I can.

We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.

We have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the Commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application.

If the quotas are being observed, surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels.


But even the Treaty of Amsterdam demands openness and transparency and so, as a body representing the interests of the citizens, Parliament should have played a full part in the proceedings, as per the undertaking it received here from the Presidency at the beginning. Another broken promise.

In this regard, it can only be helpful for the international community, whether it is the UN, the Commonwealth or the European Union, to maintain a strong and current interest in developments.
brb
During the Portuguese Presidency, there has been a political momentum within the Council of which I, as well as other MEPs, would have liked to have made use.
Mr Birdal advocates solving the problem of minorities without violence.



Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Commission, the information concerning health risks posed by depleted uranium to the population and to staff in peace-making missions in the Balkans, as well as its possible environmental consequences, has caused great concern in Europe.
Therefore, I would ask the Commission, if it does not want to talk of its data and studies - which exist - at least to calm this real fear of the farmers and reply as to whether the cost of enlargement will be met at the expense of the farmers' income and, furthermore, whether he can guarantee that it will not have an effect on Community aid.
Why is it then that this text has not been published?
That is why I fail to understand much of the mistrust of many members, but perhaps we can clear that up in the debate.
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.




There is a risk that investors will lose confidence in it.
As Members may well know, in the United Kingdom we have addressed the subject by introducing a principle of privatisation.
Mr President, first of all, I want to say thank you both to the French Presidency and to Commissioner Patten for their excellent contributions this morning.
Mr President, I also wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work on this issue.
It is in this context of external pressure that the European Union is applying in the framework of the GATT, that is, the WTO negotiations, that it seems to be a mistake to have presented this proposal at this time.


On behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Portugal, as the country holding the presidency, on organising the European Council in Lisbon, and we obviously wish you every success in your endeavours.
(SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.
We must take the precautionary approach.




That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want.
dagron yea
Every so often, I cherish the hope that we will be sufficiently clever to gain insight into a certain period and do what we have to with it.
Yesterday we heard Mr Verheugen and today the Council' s representative acknowledging, even in small measure, some of the problems related to respect for human rights in Turkey concerning which, indeed, they expressed their sorrow.


Indeed, where the interests of public services or the environment so require, we will not hesitate to advocate an active stance on the part of the authorities.



I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you.
Our fellow-citizens are waiting to be told what we are going to demand from the Intergovernmental Conference for that future.


My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.
If retained in the final version of the directive, this article would, for the first time, constitute a legal basis for discrimination in the right to work based on 'a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin' .
Many now support the demand to put a stop to the female slave trade, but more is needed in terms of manpower, intervention by governments and concrete action.



To ask the question is to answer it.
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.
The possibility of adopting the eligibility criteria will also be examined in order to respond more effectively to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.

However, whatever the merits of his case, the circumstances of his abduction were unacceptable.

Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible. Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.


Indeed I am very grateful to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for the way in which she has worked into the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy practically all the points that were contained in the draft opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for which I was responsible and which is the reason for my addressing you tonight.
We welcome Mr Fischler's generous offer to meet with leaders of the industry to discuss alternatives to the draconian proposals which have been widely publicised by the Fisheries DG in the last few days.



In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.

Thank you, President of the Council. We all share this hope.
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.
The profits from cigarette smuggling not only line the pockets of criminals but also deny revenue to the EU, which would otherwise be used in tackling cancer, poverty, the promotion of human rights, etc. In addition, cheaper cigarettes mean greater danger to health because of heavier tobacco consumption, and we must enlist the support of ministers in national and regional governments in any campaign against this.

The people of Europe, even the British, are asking for more European solutions to problems, yet at the same time they still have very little confidence in European institutions.
Firstly, the budget with its EUR 93 million in payment appropriations represents a 5% increase, whereas national budgets are subject to greater austerity.
Article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based.
Mr President, Commissioner, if we truly want to improve the environment and allow railways to take the pressure off our over-congested European roads, I believe we should pursue three objectives. Firstly, those responsible for managing the infrastructure and charged with ensuring good use of the latter must be completely separate from and independent of service operators and users.
hey guys and dolls, isn't there no way to connect to this chatroom from PCs whose port 6667 are blocked ?


The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights.

We therefore voted against the creation of the Rapid Reaction Facility, just as we shall vote against any budget allocations to support it.


I do not think this is the case.
Questions Nos 10 to 38 will be replied to in writing.
Firstly, on behalf of the Committee which I chair, I would like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Lamy for his patience, perseverance and the skilful contacts he has been holding constantly not only with the Chinese authorities, but also with other important members of the Council of the WTO, in particular the United States, which have allowed both the Congress of the United States and the European Union to reach a preliminary agreement on the membership of China, the importance of which is obvious because it will incorporate into the World Trade Organisation more than a billion people, with all the challenges and possibly positive responses that this will involve.


Delays in transposition are an endemic problem in the Commission.

Madam President, I support this proposal and justify it on the basis of the fact that quite a lot has been said about Iran recently.

Thirdly, the European Union, under pressure from the United Kingdom in particular, failed to reach a specific agreement and binding timetable on tax information, leaving tax havens free to operate within the Union.
Such agreements have a particularly negative impact on the financially disadvantaged, as existing free trade agreements have shown.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets welcomes the proposed rapid reaction facility.

Mr President, as high a priority as possible ought to be given to transparency and to keeping EU citizens informed of the work being done in the EU.
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is crystal clear: on 4 May, the 'Hushkits' regulation enters into force in the European Union.
bob2, still didn't get it installed on this lappie.  that odd reason I metioned.  but it's installling now on an 8200 inspiron


All of that will be possible thanks to the magnificent work of the Members of this Parliament and Mr Costa in particular.
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.
We also saw the problems and delays in resolving the conflict with the people in the southern part of the country, specifically the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
In this regard, therefore, the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the Union.


The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the Lisbon decisions.
We face the prospect of a European Union with 27 or perhaps even 28 members, and what becomes clear from reading this report carefully is that this enlarged Union will contain greater disparities, greater inequalities, to an extent unprecedented in previous rounds of enlargement.
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	fender	i got the audio from an mpeg file, using ffmpeg, but you need to use a few commands in the terminal or shell.
We need to propose to the Member States that all judges should gradually be trained and that this should be the sine qua non for the promotion of older judges to more senior positions and for the admission of newcomers to the bench.

We have planned an informal Council meeting, a Justice and Home Affairs Council, for the end of this month, in Marseilles, and, to that end, we have tabled this issue on the agenda.

We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.

sabdfl: dure

Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing.

Parliament has only one reading on this, which is another reflection which was not corrected at the Nice Summit of the democratic deficit.
The committee has worked well for some time but, as of a week ago, the Israeli Government decided to break contact with it until after the elections.

I also support it on behalf of my group, because we believe that this is such an important issue - as Mr Deprez has said - that it requires the attention of the whole House.


Mr President, the idea that the Mediterranean is the number one priority of European Union external policy stems from the conviction that, although the Mediterranean is no longer the centre of the world, each and every one of the great contradictions and challenges of the twenty-first century are concentrated there.
We have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector.
Mr President, in actual fact, suffice it to say that I concur with Mr van den Bos, and I would like to take the opportunity to emphasise how fitting Parliament' s recommendations are here.
Railways in Europe are in terminal decline, not least in the rail freight sector.



These conclusions, which will form the basis for the proposal for a Council directive which the Commission will table in the spring, contain, among other things, provisions stating that host Member States shall provide specialist health care to asylum seekers who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious acts of cruelty.

That is the truth of the matter.

I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.



Young people must be induced to start farming.
But it is essential to maintain this effort over time if it is to bear the desired fruit, in the interests of young people and therefore of Europe.

Who wishes to speak in support of this request?
It is perfectly clear that there is abuse, for example in connection with asylum claims.
Mr President, I just wanted to ask one question. I did not notice Mrs Buitenweg this morning and I would like to apologise to her for that.

The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.
This idea seems to me particularly important, for it emphasises coexistence.
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.
Yet the Court of Auditors, in the very report that we have been talking about, says the following things: the difficulties encountered are caused by the limited development of the principle in terms of concepts and methodology and the joint failure to find appropriate and effective procedures for verifying it.

The first is of a general nature.
You have therefore not answered my question.
occy: isn't that hoary?



In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.


Portugal is a perfect example of what I have just been talking about, and as it is a perfect example, it merits a thorough explanation.




Why does a former hero of a nation, the father figure of a struggle for independence, now allow the use of violence simply to underpin his own authority?

Moreover, the beneficiaries of family reunification are not just the applicant's spouse and children under 18, but also the unmarried partner who is in a stable relationship with the applicant, which will include homosexual couples when the Member State' s legislation treats them in the same way as married couples for legal purposes.

tritium, I'm running hoary too;)


There is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers. These workers are sometimes obliged to strike out of self-preservation.
In other words, it will no longer be possible to dispose of cars illegally or to abandon them somewhere in the woods. Nor will there be the impulse to export them in one way or another to Eastern Europe.

His cooperation with the national ombudsmen is also important, as will be his future cooperation with the corresponding bodies in the candidate countries.

It is my opinion, however, that the responsibility of policy-makers - which may be more difficult, more complex - is to regulate certain issues, set limits and avoid situations out of a western.


If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.


We have been working in this area for almost ten years and for the last five, the significant MEDA programme has been available to us.
It would be a gross abuse of the democratic process for the Commission to undertake a euro propaganda campaign in those countries before referenda on the currency take place.
However, in key areas, the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything.
Mr President, today we are discussing two new international fishing protocols between the European Union and third countries: Guinea and Mauritius, the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.
So we are asking in this question, Commissioner, for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April.
My Group has therefore been compelled either to abstain or to vote against the report.
try another package maybe?

I now wish to ask the Commissioner whether he can tell us anything about the report' s conclusions on the CAP.
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)

!!! HACK !!!
The Charter of Fundamental Rights must give citizens the capacity to demand compliance with these rights in the European courts.
Secondly, you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the Pomés report.
We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas.





Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?
As for the situation you describe, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that the policy is disastrous. This is the only possible policy, as you know, and it is a result of everything that has happened in the region in the last few years and even in the last few decades.
They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement.

This is the European Union' s declared aim.
Taxes and social security contributions in the European Union are high compared to the United States, but the picture changes fundamentally when we consider the sometimes extortionate insurance premiums which American citizens have to pay.
This has also been the case this time.
Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.
In the light of such considerations, there is a general obligation to make an ethical assessment.
We therefore chose to highlight the issues associated with education, training and information policies and the social and cultural life of young farmers.
The assets we have as Europeans in the form of cultural differences are easier to maintain and to accept if citizens know that they can claim their rights throughout the Union.

Our bleeding hearts will, of course, reproach us for refusing to give scientific research the resources it needs in order to progress and even worse, to cure our illnesses.
Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan.


This continued erosion of the milk industry is, I am afraid, part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry.

That concludes Questions to the Commission.

Bad Gateway: the proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

We can avoid the vote on Amendment No 1 by holding a split vote on the original text of paragraph b).
Can we not help to foster fellowship and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish peoples?
The two sides of industry must be associated with this initiative by means budgetary resources allocated by the European institutions.

Madam President, I will now turn to the Commission' s decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective.
The UN ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time.

But this requires the Council, which must abandon its tradition of secrecy, to cooperate better with the European Parliament and to speak more openly. Only in this way can the work of the Commission and our own work progress more quickly, especially in our own committee, where there are many issues that directly affect our citizens.


Every time one of the groups can be relied upon to say, "Yes, it is important, but you must see that Mr Ben Ali is still just settling in."

These guidelines will also be transposed into national policies, and will be periodically monitored and assessed as part of a process of mutual learning between Member States.


hrm ok
This is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions.



Madam President, it falls to you to conclude.


The next item is the oral question (B5-0223/2000) by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the Commission, on the installation of the MOX demonstration facility at the British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield.


He knew, nonetheless, that this miracle was not a random event, but rather the outcome of proactive and constructive commitment, based on common objectives and efficient institutions.

The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.
Mr President, we all stressed, both today and yesterday, the importance that we attach to Mediterranean policy and to the need to urgently reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, which is all too often disregarded.
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.

My vision of European construction is compatible with the fundamental lines which are laid out in the report which we are discussing today.


It was rightly pointed out in numerous debates and in the report that good cooperation and the involvement of the Member States are essential if the fight against fraud to the detriment of the financial interests of the European Community is to be efficient.
But we must be aware that they are being defamed by some nationalist forces in these countries who say that they are victors' courts.



Let me now turn to the first specific issue which is the implications of the MOX data issue for the safety of nuclear installations.
Question No 46 will therefore be replied to in writing.

But, more importantly, it is the north-south link in the east of the present Union.

since they're going to talk to me anyway ;-)


Both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings.
With everything which has been said about diamond trafficking and the halting of other dealings which finance the local war, and with everything which has been said about the need to intervene, what we need at the end of the day is a political solution.

Aside from a few technical explanations relating to details, such as the exact number of ECB staff, there is only one valid reason that can be cited: the euro-optimism surrounding the launch of the euro, as it was called at the time, led people to believe that the single currency would naturally be strong and that the question of reserves was, therefore, secondary.


Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Lalumière, on the report which she produced for our Parliament and in which she managed to strike a fine balance.
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?
So, there a howto? ;0
Investments are already being made, in anticipation of the directive. For example, in Antwerp, very near to where I live, a huge installation is being built which was not there before.
Outside help will also be needed to regain law and order.

When you come to the extremes that have been reached this year, you have to wonder what economic sector could survive with these rules of play.
One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges.





I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.

vegai, http://www.fs-security.com/
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.
I feel as if we are involved in a headlong pursuit to implement solutions that seem obvious, but that do not take account of the specificity of air traffic control.

For example, my city, Rome, is organising the young artists' biannual event in Sarajevo and funding the Sarajevo Concert Hall, precisely to give a sense of the reconstruction of a society within which there is dialogue, but which has dialogue with us as well.
Against the background of Kofi Annan' s words, the question arises as to whether the people do not consider the organising of solemn rituals such as those in Cairo as a conspiracy among élites.
well, atm i have one comp and it'll be both a server and a desktop

Let us hope that most European businesses and most European research experts will promote the shift from the European Patent to the Community Patent so that the competitiveness of the European Union is improved as much as possible.
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?


I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.

Does this mean that the European Parliament, which has worked harder than anyone else to achieve a European Community patent, will not be involved, or at least be updated in good time and on a regular basis?




Ten dollars per barrel of oil was far too low a price and, furthermore, it had negative effects on our economies, although this seems more complicated to explain.


Admittedly, as I said earlier, its relative importance to the Community GDP is small, but we must not forget that ours is the fourth largest fleet in the world.


Finally, I believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither Parliament' s nor the Council' s initial proposal.
I am grateful to Mr Solbes for the intention behind his reply, which is to safeguard and show concern for worker' s conditions.

I would therefore have liked your report to have taken account of the Treaty provisions relating to general interest services and to have included proposals for measures designed to guarantee citizens' access to public services in energy.
umm it should be called the sudo terminal


That causes major congestion problems but it also causes major environmental problems as well - not only the noise and pollution for people living around the airports but also the impact on global climate.
One of the priorities which has been identified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of the financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investments in knowledge.
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.

We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.
Clearly, in the context of new technologies, a situation where State subsidies to public service broadcasters are used for commercial ends must be avoided, as this would distort the principle of competitiveness with private companies instead of ensuring compliance with specific content obligations.

Furthermore, there has been much less research on the substitutes for phthalates than on the phthalates themselves.



We can only make permanent improvements through combined, broad-based dialogue on the part of NGOs and the national authorities.


However, I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either.
Once this balm and these nice sentiments have been applied to the galling wounds of real life, our rapporteur becomes well aware that sport is not a cultural phenomenon but a political and strategic instrument used to enslave the citizen, who is made to forget the loss of his civic powers through a form of televisual training developing age-old instincts.



Mr President, an essential element in the reconstruction of post-war society is always that recovery of the local economy should be as rapid as possible, so that it becomes viable once more.

It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.
What I mean to say is that, in any event, I share the Commission' s concern and I think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one.
As a gesture of goodwill I will be accepting five small amendments from the EPP, though incidentally none of those mentioned by Mr Evans.
The question today is whether those initial steps, which were promised at the time in order to obtain the discharge, have actually been made.
I endorse the rapporteur' s observations that proposals are required which deal with the social dimension.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome, on your behalf, a delegation from the Maltese Parliament, which is currently visiting our institution.

It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.
I know Sri Lanka, I have been there.
Your response in this matter is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion.

The Commission proposes a quota of 353 000 tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand.
I believe the speech you gave in Paris was significant in this respect.

We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.

This is why simple procedures are being proposed for the rapid reaction facility.
If we can provide this, then, at the same time, we will have overcome our present difficulties and set the wheels in motion for a new perspective for the future.
The first which I should like to mention are the Roma and Sinti; they represent a very large section of the population and we must seriously consider how they can be sensibly integrated into society.



Mr President, I would also like to draw the attention of the Portuguese Presidency to the fact that the aim of Article 8 of our resolution is, from within the European Parliament, to make a positive contribution to resolving the running conflict with Austria.


Finally, I would like to join the Members who have spoken in expressing my profound shame at the incident.
Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services?



plattypus1: and your motherboard chipset and HD drivers?
It seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the European sky.

Without consumer confidence, e-commerce is going nowhere.
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.
This is the polite euphemism for corruption, and that is what we must control here.


This, in my opinion, is a sine qua non.




This shows that there is the political will and discernment needed from the European institutions to put a new policy into practice.

Of course I shall ask straight away for this document that you have mentioned to be analysed too, if it is not being examined already, and if we do not have it, which would be strange, may I ask you to provide us with a copy.
In Ecuador, 60% of banana producers are small producers with less than 20 hectares, and they are suffering from unjustifiable discrimination.


As usual we should make it very clear that we in the Development Committee regard the budget figure that we have here before us, as purely indicative.
rwabel: it will get lighter and faster..... ita a matter of time ;)
The PPE-DE Group and, to the best of my knowledge, the whole of Parliament, support the Commission' s work while voicing constructive criticism.






When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.
Without this exemption, it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis, for each bovine animal exported from its region.
yeah, ive maximized it :)

The European monitoring centre in Vienna is an important institution, the purpose of which is to provide objective, reliable, comparable data on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and to act as a basic design tool at both European and national level.

But some have had to wait for it longer than others.
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.
Objections have been submitted by ecological organisations, who complain that many of the works planned under the scheme will affect areas declared as sites of Community interest by the Spanish Government, seriously threatening protected species, by trade unions and farmers' associations, who stress the negative aspects of the plan and propose a thorough revision, and by many local authorities, who have drawn attention to the inconsiderate planning of some of the diversions and their social and economic consequences for people living in the areas concerned. All these social agents have expressed the wish that the Commission should take up a position on the plan and should contact the Spanish Government urging it to correct its negative aspects.
However, the poverty dimension in what we are trying to support and promote means that more intensified small-scale production is what we are supporting.
But, above all, we need decisive action on the part of the European Union, the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area.
I do not normally believe that persons who have not been convicted of crimes should be prevented from moving freely, but there is a European problem that is being ignored at European level.

I want us to be allowed to get on with it, and I want us to be as accountable as possible to this Parliament and to the Council for what we are doing.
They brutally attacked the families of political prisoners protesting outside the jails and likewise on hunger strike.
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .

Knowing as we do from the Echelon interception system that every form of democratic control is being flagrantly violated from without or from a distance, knowing that American multinationals are engaged in wholesale monitoring and spying at the expense of European undertakings and the economic, social, political and cultural activities of the Member States and the private life of the Union citizens as a whole, it is slightly hypocritical of us to approach this huge issue in stockinged feet with our prayer-book in hand.

That is the direction in which things are heading with the classification of countries, which, rather than taking into account the most basic factor, which is the existence or non-existence of cases of encephalopathy in their raised cattle, takes account of other factors when allocating countries to a particular category.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor to explain the reasons why I am going to vote against the motion and my concern over two issues, which were included in the resolution at the request of some Members, who, I feel, are trying to exploit the credibility of the European Parliament in order to further their own interests, which conflict with the general interests of the Community as a whole and Italy in particular.

As part of our preparations for that meeting I have gone through the bulk of what we are doing on primary education in Africa and I am happy to say that I am in a position to express something positive about what I have seen in the Commission.
It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals.
This is logical, since he is also chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
I am all in favour of the same yardstick, but the same yardstick does not necessarily give the same results.
Report (A5-0217/2000) by Mr J. Evans on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the competition rules relating to horizontal cooperation agreements (C5-0304/2000 - 2000/2154(COS))

I have to tell Parliament that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of our system.
Rather than unnecessary amendments, I should like a response to the following question.
The second aim of my amendments was by means of the activities set up in the context of this European Year to pay special attention to socially vulnerable groups, migrants and semi-skilled and unskilled workers.
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.
The aim is to prevent him from having to comply with the different legal provisions of all the countries in which his clients may reside.

Overlapping and conflicts between the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights should, in any event, be avoided.

Turkey has its internal problems, but it has its external problems, too. It could, for instance, show willing by accepting the jurisdiction of the court in The Hague, or the Court of Human Rights.
(SV) We conservatives support most of the measures against racism and xenophobia in the Ludford report.
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.
For the first time, the European Union is facing the possibility of having representatives in the Council of Ministers and here among us of a party which obviously holds views and puts forward legislation contrary to the values of the European Union.


May I insist, therefore, that at least this type of adaptation to requirements is implemented and that the Community of Europe, the single market, is given access to a world which is so important, particularly for the SMEs where, in effect, the productivity of design and creativity - which for the European countries naturally represents a boost for jobs and employment - fits perfectly into this network of rights and freedoms.



There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.
Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot.

Even though I know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted, it should only be granted in the most exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology.
now I know why people wear those _Insert name_ broke my gnome   t-shirts



Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.
I shall make three comments on this matter, to illustrate the gravity of the problem.


And may I ask: how do they know?

The main opposition party, while challenging the results in 20 constituencies, has also accepted the results of the elections.




The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.

Military action is always an extreme measure, and somebody must always suffer the consequences.



billytwowilly, good deal



Given a task to do, Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before.

Mr Cabanis' dream is today close to becoming reality.

For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.



This is an excellent idea and advantage can be taken of the experience accumulated under the Eures network.


The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.

The process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the European legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law.
As regards other contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund, it may be worth noting that the draft budget by the US administration suggests a US contribution of USD 600 million which follows on from pledges made earlier and which corresponds to the share of HIPC calculated by the World Bank for the US.

there were a handful of people that raised their hand at the NM meeting
In the Committee on Petitions, we are aware of the terrible frustration felt by those citizens who take the trouble to report environmental crimes and see that, in Europe, we are incapable of coming to their aid in order to improve the natural environment in which they live and to prevent these crimes.

For example, the time span for noise reduction is very long.
The date for payment may, however, have to be postponed if major problems are encountered in the organisation of Guinea-Bissau' s administration, that is, its government, following this armed conflict.
The European Union is, moreover, already active in these fields.

Let me now turn to the amendments.
Members will therefore understand that it is the practice in the United Kingdom Government, like, I imagine, most or all other governments, not to comment on alleged interception whether the allegations are based on trivia or something perhaps more substantial.

We are doing much for South Africa and I hope, in return, President Mbeki will work for peace in the region, with particular reference to Zimbabwe.


What I am trying to do, is to breathe life into a process that could easily slip into pure practicalities.
Just now, I think it was Mr Seppänen who brought up a subject which I consider to be an absolute priority, i.e. access to the information society, not just for young people or students, but also for the older elements of the general public, and sections of the population that are often forgotten, such as farmers or small- and medium-sized businesses.




It is a shame that we have not been able to deal with this problem as what it is, a matter of criminal law, but have had instead to deal with it within the strait-jacket of the internal market context.

This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts.

Now, this rich biodiversity - which, moreover, is not confined to plant species - has a financial consequence which is in itself truly impressive.



tritium: this should be
The conclusion which we draw from this draft regulation is that it is probably an attempt to cover up the situation.

This is actually the Spanish Government's strategy towards the Basque country.

Twenty years ago, I myself had the opportunity to serve in Pyongyang and know what it means to be confronted directly with the reality of that country.
Of course, with the economic structure which we would like to have and which is strongly supported by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and which we want to use to push Europe forward, it is necessary and it makes sense for Europe' s development in information and communications technologies to combine these two aspects.
We need a framework of regulations at international level. We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.



After all, playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being.

This meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world.

The two sides of industry are also extremely active in this area.
It really is unacceptable to work like this in this Chamber!

For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.


These are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam.

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
(The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)


As far as the Commission is concerned we would like them to be rejected by Parliament, in the same way as Amendments Nos 1 and 2 will hopefully be rejected.
They will consist of definitions, charges and penalties in the fight against the trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation and measures against the sexual exploitation of children.
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 11 May 2000 has been distributed.
Yes, of course it affects south-west France, but only to a degree. Its real impact is on the whole of the centre and west of the Iberian Peninsula, that is, most of Spain and Portugal.

I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.

We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.
Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced, the number of Members should not be increased.


In particular, when will Mr Alain Richard, Minister of Defence, be willing to appear at a part-session?

Accordingly, I regret that some MEPs are adding to the chaos by suggesting in an amendment that the existing infrastructure should disappear, or that major new projects are not viable.

and i would imagine it supports pcmcia cards that it supports under x86
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.
On the contrary, the report registers a very positive response to the government, because it is pursuing successful counter-strategies, some of which go beyond the standards set by other EU countries.
We cannot leave it simply to governments.
Although the High Level Working Group itself has concluded that human rights violations are an important reason why people flee, too little account of this is taken in the action plans.
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.
Further to this Conference, I would like to single out five key points from my report.

The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.




I am therefore voting against the proposal.
lostmonk,

In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.
The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services.
We cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time.
Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on the Barcelona Process, I would like to communicate some of the concerns and suggestions which have been unanimously approved in committee.
In practice, women are often discriminated against during this period, despite rights on paper.

Firstly, we must say that if we achieve harmonised asylum procedures, the level of requests will also tend to become more homogenised.

If we look back at the history of what has happened in Fiji, we see a sweeping electoral victory by the Fijian Labour Party in the May 1999 General Election when they won, with their supporting parties, 58 out of the 71 seats, ousting the incumbent right-wing government.



It can and must forcefully tackle race discrimination and xenophobia making the EU a world leader in the celebration of multicultural and ethnic diversity.

I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, for his excellent work and the spirit of cooperation that he has sought to promote in his approach to this important issue.




Those who trust in the idea that, thanks to official equality and the passage of time, self-regulatory mechanisms will work in favour of social balance, are mistaken, because they do not appreciate the fact that, although equality before the law and equality of opportunity are necessary conditions, they are not sufficient in themselves.
In view of the fact that the Commission proposal, in my modest opinion, meets these requirements, I shall support it.


A number of the points raised by the resolution, for example on regionalisation and on the evaluation of our network of external representations, are already covered in our own communication.
My committee also considers that the provision of the regulation which seeks to protect the weaker parties in a contract should be approved.
A great deal of criticism of European effectiveness has to do with the way in which these tasks are organised.

In essence, these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries, such as Spain, I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding.

And thirdly, the European Union must demand that President Pastrana puts an end to all violations of human rights by paramilitary groups in his country, and that the sad world records of thousands of victims that are reached each year should come to an end.

However, we cannot tolerate international agreements of this kind being used by certain groups in Belgium to their advantage in order to undermine the language legislation which guarantees the tolerant co-existence of the three language communities" .

I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.


Finally, the Commission is unable to approve Amendment 24 relating to committee procedures because of the legal changes implemented following the decision on committee procedures, according to which a prescriptive committee is required.

Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.

Mr President, I must make it quite clear that I do not agree with the conclusions of my fellow Italian who has just spoken.


As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.
ChrisC_: chatzilla runs on linux too
We also welcome the opportunity to report back to the European Parliament on the progress of our efforts to establish a solid scientific basis on the effects of depleted uranium.

(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
So I suggest that we urge the Commission to hold a longer and deeper dialogue about this; not to precipitate action but to measured consideration.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must continue to bear these positive aspects in mind. Now, as promised, I should like to devote some time to answering the set of criticisms expressed in the report.
Enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways.
This Council initiative is essential because it is not possible to allow childhood and naivety to be exploited for degrading commercial purposes, in denial of all humane values.
I am almost inclined to resist any involvement in a discussion about which type of lethal ammunition is the better.
- (PT) On the grounds that it is necessary to identify and prevent the granting of subsidies that distort competition and to increase transparency in relations between the State and public enterprises, the Commission is creating bureaucratic arrangements and real restrictions which may undermine the delivery of high-quality public services.
sorry i am wrong gui = xserver


I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.



Mr Solana, I thank you for your first speech, not least because of the spirit of openness that you demonstrated.
The opinion of the Committee on Industry is wholly favourable and I recommend that the House votes unanimously for the motions during tomorrow' s sitting.
We have had to conclude that, contrary to our expectations, the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it, will decrease.
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.
But I would like to add 'the country of residence or employment principle' , twice.

Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you heard from our Group chairman earlier in the debate, the EPP visited Berlin last week.
For years, we have been looking for strategies for a society which pays lip service to the idea that women must be given all opportunities, but which has so little input when it comes to setting up binding, effective strategies in order to achieve this.




This has also been noted by the European Parliament in some of its amendments.
I feel that she has produced a report which proposes practical solutions, as many of us wished, and I thank her for that.

I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.
I hope that these thousands of tonnes of food aid provided do not silence the media and that they continue to report on the tragedy in Africa.
The peoples involved had nothing in common in terms of language, culture and religion and there are also striking differences in their appearance.
Paragraph 3, which indicates that the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels might be used, is wrong.

Madam President, I wish to add my voice to those of the speakers who raised the issue of the tragedy that took place in Portugal last weekend.
For many families with gluten intolerant children, life is very difficult and the extra work involved in managing their diet is tremendous.
It is the country with the greatest growth and with the greatest advances in terms of social modernisation, particularly in terms of education and the status of women; however it is the country in which the emergence of a civil society, which is born of this economic and social growth, does not have adequate means to express itself in complete freedom.



Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.

They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.
A few weeks ago, Turkey signed both UN conventions on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights.
Political oversight is exercised by a House of Commons committee, which has full access to documentation.
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.

It is also very important that all of us secure the right climate for enterprise, with less red tape and less bureaucracy, to encourage SMEs and risk-takers to actually consider taking out risk capital in the first place.


I have no doubt that the Commissioner' s proposals will achieve that simplification.
I want to make it absolutely plain that the Commission shares these concerns.
In adopting such a stance, he set a very high standard, not just for the Austrian Government but, indirectly, for all the others too.
I cannot speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland, never mind the island of Ireland, because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world.
I am also pleased to note that the results of the elections have been universally accepted by all participating parties.
Finally, we need to implement the Feira decisions on relations with NATO and with third counties in connection with military crisis management and the continuing work to strengthen civil crisis management instruments.

It is extremely important to couple these two kinds of measures: criminalisation of trafficking and, at the same time, having a proactive policy on promoting the cooperation of the victims with the police and with the judiciary in convicting those who are responsible for such degrading activity.
We already saw this last year, when the Union hid behind the United States and other countries until the last moment in order to avoid adopting any real initiative on Chechnya and on the People' s Republic of China.
The summits and meetings have always been held with the presence of all the countries involved, including Syria, Lebanon and Israel.

The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.

I am thinking in particular of the proposal by Commissioner Vitorino on readmission agreements with the countries of origin, such as China, for example, with regard to making the trafficking in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation a specific crime.

We should adopt new rules on jurisdiction which trust consumers to make an informed choice about which jurisdiction they want to opt for.



Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?



What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.


Furthermore, I believe that all the false logic which is used when referring to migrant workers has no place in this debate, not so much because of the subject matter but rather because it is not appropriate for the study of these directives.
It will certainly benefit European security and defence policy to be discussed outside the constellation that prevails in the Member States, where governments and oppositions are constantly trying to score political points on these issues.



We wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied, and applied as quickly as possible.

There can thus be no people' s Europe without a family-oriented Europe.



I have two comments to make on this.
Afterwards I will give my opinion and that of my group on this.



The Commission is now actively participating in the work on the draft United Nations protocol on trafficking to supplement the draft convention on trans-national organised crime and I sincerely hope that the members of the United Nations will be able to adopt this new convention in autumn this year.

If the precautionary principle is not to be employed in respect of one of the most vulnerable consumer groups - our children - it is very difficult to imagine when, in fact, it is to be employed.
Such formal statements are not necessarily sufficient.

I must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts.


We have a good example of this here.
I should just like to make a few more comments on behalf of my group on a number of necessary amendments on which both we and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party reached extensive agreement in the run-up.
sabdfl: yes, of course

We are talking about a concrete action plan setting out how quite specific improvements in procurement, buildings and human resources policy can be achieved, and I call on the House to vote for this.



No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play, but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for.

These two articles, in whatever combination, have to be read together.

The report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away.
I would like to remind you that the European Union is active in several areas with regard to the fight for human rights in that country.

I want to ask the Commissioner very straightforwardly and point-blank whether the Commission, and Parliament, and the European Union are being held to ransom by Morocco because of its unwillingness to agree.
The matters which were not put to the vote that Friday - including the important issue of Ethiopia - were voted on in Brussels and the results were almost unanimous.

In view of all the difficulties which undeniably exist, I regard this as a key starting point for greater effectiveness and thus more efficient use of the appropriations implemented, and I believe that this is something that people hit by unemployment in the various countries would welcome.



Many countries listen and take note of signals from 'Brussels' .
You all know that competition law has been one of the most important objectives of the European Union - and therefore of the European Commission - since the founding Treaties came into existence.
Parliament employed its powers in a sound manner under special circumstances.
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?
The national authorities should provide for the necessary financial resources to consolidate this action for the period 2000-06.

That is why we are in favour of establishing quotas for the scheme.
This concludes the remarks which I would like to make on behalf of the Commission at the end of this debate.




In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.



Please allow me to express, not a criticism, but surprise in relation to the unassailable legal basis.
On the one hand, by means of research, aimed at reducing consumption.
The law of the offenders' country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution.
The needs of the forestry industry must also be taken into account in commercial policy.
We need to look very carefully at those.

As a result, aid is now unable to reach a large part of its own population.

Debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency.
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.
Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, on supplementary assistance for the budget of Moldova gives us a rare opportunity to cast our eyes on this small country on the periphery of the European Union, on its economic development and political orientation.
After all, there are huge interests at stake: the certainty and safety of our primary products, and hence consumer confidence.

The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.




The EC consequently takes the view that there is absolutely no lack of clarity about the specifications given in his written answer by Commissioner Patten when he said, and I quote in the original English:

I like the film, but I would hate to see it time and again.

Perhaps not according to the letter of the Treaty but certainly according to its spirit, Parliament must be involved in any proposed policy measure.
I will take a decision on this in the next few months depending on developments in Zimbabwe.
how can I see what devices ( usb) are connected to my puter'

2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: are you referring to alsa-driver or alsa-lib?
What a discrepancy between the aid promised and the aid actually provided!
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.

She, herself, has also indicated that this is an important issue for which little is being done, for which politicians hardly have any consideration, and, as we can see, it is extremely difficult to lend this matter some clarity.

Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.


Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.



It has done the same with regard to the appropriations requested to improve the financial environment of SMEs and the start up of the LIFE 3 programme.
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.
In other words, what we are talking about here is an amendment to cut out the offending elements of the patent, thereby rendering it lawful, and not its revocation in its entirety.

If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!

The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.

I am making a personal commitment to do so. An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?

Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.
This House has been utterly lax on the substance and yet, at the same time, is asking for ever greater decision-making power to the detriment of the national parliaments.

- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is due to state its position at second reading on the regulation that forms the legal base for the general framework of cooperation between the European Union and South Africa.


It is not the tobacco growers' problem, because they will inevitably grow the kind of tobacco the market demands.


Indeed, I think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the Portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy.

If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.
It is outrageous that some people import and use labour and then go unpunished.


Previously, when Members were present for the vote and an explanation of vote was made in writing, it was possible to leave, as the President used to state that he had received such and such a written explanation of vote on such and such a report.
Not to renew that agreement would be a backwards step in our Mediterranean policy, because if that policy is to be more than empty rhetoric, we must make progress in specific cases.


The next item is the report (A5-0358/2000) by Mrs Poli Bortone, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee on the progress of the implementation of the action programme of the communication on intermodality and intermodal freight transport in the European Union.
In this respect I must add the following comment in response to Mr van Velzen. The Council has no information allowing it to conclude that any company, including the companies mentioned, has benefited or been damaged as a result of telecommunications being intercepted by this system.



Commissioner, perhaps you could even use this receptiveness to new ideas, which you displayed in the delegation in Sarajevo, as an example for other delegations in other countries to follow.

Finally, I share the opinion expressed by Mr Cox and Mrs Berès on the deadlines that need to be respected in the great European debate.
Meanwhile, I would like to tell you that the Commission will take account of the results of the work of the monitoring centre for traffic in the Pyrenees when reviewing the Trans-European Network and we hope that this review will be ready before August.

The work on the traceability of all the information regarding the animal' s country of provenance and country of birth and, in particular, where the animal was fattened, is therefore excellent.

The Dublin Convention in itself has always been important but it is the flaws in the Dublin Convention and our failure to administer the Dublin Convention properly, which has caused issues to arise which could even threaten the human rights of some of the applicants and individuals concerned.

At the same time, we do not think the states that already belong to the European Union are in a position to teach lessons to countries that are only at the stage of applying for accession, given the extent to which the ignominy of racism and xenophobia is being propagated in most of the Member States of the European Union itself, by demagogues from the extreme right, even and including some within this Parliament.

As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that.
In closing, I should like to commend and thank both Mr Böge, the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment.
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.



The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.
The European Parliament emerged from those long negotiations victorious on several crucial points.



Of all the many words in this communication, just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue.
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.
And here again I would remind you that in an area of Greece, in the area of Fthiotida, where everyone is against bridging the Maliako Gulf which, it should be noted the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works itself included in the Natura 2000 areas, your office has received complaints about the Greek Government's intention to build this bridge, which will have a huge environmental impact, even though alternative solutions exist.
Is it correct to assume that the EU' s extremely sparse powers in the fields of social policy and employment will be expanded in the future?


ah, shoot

Beyond its immediate environment, the French Presidency will ensure that it develops political dialogue with the main regional blocs.
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the report.
There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation.


Mr Bautista Ojeda, as for sleeping in their own homes, I am not sure if it is feasible that we could achieve that from here at this time, but we take good note of your intervention, which will appear in the Minutes, since I suppose you would also like that to happen.
I am glad to see the amended proposal takes up Parliament's demand to erase the data when an individual has got a subsidiary or temporary form of protection, but could I enquire whether this would cover for example - in the system I know best - the UK's exceptional leave to remain?


Even so, the euro has not become a weak currency.


ADRs, therefore, cannot be a replacement for legal remedy.

As co-author I urge the House and the Council to support this motion.
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity.


Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report.
For all these reasons, my committee voted in favour of Mr Dary' s draft report.
The stated political aim of these programmes is to encourage the opening up of these countries' markets to European capital.

The first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the European Union.
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.
But the Council' s decision seems to be leading to a situation now where the whole development of the security and defence policy in the political sphere can no longer be properly monitored, being, as it were, beyond that.
It is worth noting, however, that we have heard this argument since discussions about Directive 90/220/EEC first started in 1989.

Rather than concentrating on protecting minorities, we should be building the concept of European citizenship involving common values. We should be concentrating on building a common future for everyone and a society in which everyone can develop and which totally rejects any hint of submission to barbarism.
I particularly want to stress a clause which she mentioned in her own speech: recital (e) says that on the eve of several successive enlargements the conduct of the current Member States of the Union in the application of Community law must be exemplary.


Fifthly, we do not need the Commission to use its influence on national governments in the event of domestic industrial disputes, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report; we need a smoothly running social dialogue between all the players involved in air traffic!
I am therefore seeking your assurance that until impact studies have been carried out and the members of Parliament have been informed, this project will not be the covered by an exception.
Therefore we need to make improvements in that respect as well.
After the election, obviously, Mr Fujimori' s government could argue that since their candidate Fujimori had obtained more than 51%, it had to be concluded that even in the absence of any opposition, the vote was valid.
These two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments.
Those in the European capitals ought to learn that strengthening Europe' s standing can do the same for their own image.

Now, my reaction may well be over-cautious, but I am very suspicious of those who say: let us raise fines, let us increase the sanctions, without, however, telling us what these fines and sanctions are.

If we analyse the situation, we realise that, on the one hand, we are talking about an almost irrecoverable debt and, on the other, that in return for cancelling that debt, we can demand greater respect for human rights, greater democracy and social actions benefiting poor communities - improving conditions for children, the elderly and the disabled.

Enthusiastic young people from our two countries met.


The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.
This is a sensitive subject, involving a sector with very specific characteristics and one which affects some quite typical and fairly limited regions in Europe.


In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.




Therefore it is absolutely true that the left must reflect on their past too, as must the right.
BAT - the best available technology - is the fundamental prerequisite of EMAS, because it would be downright absurd for a company to be regarded as an environmental trailblazer if it did not use the best available technology, and it is surely plain to see that anything else boils down to ISO 14000, in other words to our simply selling EMAS down the river, because it would then be ISO in another guise.

We now seem, of course, to have two spokespersons for the Commission: the official one, Commissioner Schreyer, and the unofficial one, Mrs Morgan. The latter' s statement here aptly illustrates why this Parliament is in no position to be more effective in cleaning up the administration.



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has of course followed the whole election process in Peru, and with mounting concern.

That is twice as many as under the Pinochet regime.
May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community body; its existence and its actions are derived from an international agreement to which all the Member States of the European Union and four other countries are a party, but not the Community itself.
In view of the fact that the programmes will in part be continuing up to 2006, no further measures are planned under this budget heading.
If you want to cancel that and put Iraq in place of the world forum on training, then you must move that and we will then vote on it under item IV when it' s the world forum' s turn.
This report, whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following, the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation.



I only regret that the word Russia was not mentioned by either gentleman because it occurs to me that the situation in Russia is worrying.

This means that the president of the sitting strictly applied the Rules of Procedure.

I am delighted that after all these years, it has at long last started work and is evidently serving the people well.


We must not overlook what has been achieved in the way of positive results.
The Council does not receive any information on the reasons why Member States grant or refuse export licences and therefore cannot assess the grounds on which these decisions are based.


I would therefore like to make some observations with regard to the railway sector' s critical state.

Most Member States have already set dates for them and most of them have also assured me that these meetings will be open, with the participation of all possible parties including, of course, Members of the European Parliament.
We have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in South Africa.

Under these circumstances, the warning could be formulated thus: that the European Union formally calls for an end to violence and for talks to go ahead but, at the same time, as commercial partner and financial sponsor, it will take the necessary action against any parties who believe they can pull out of the talks and abandon the attempt to find a global and definitive compromise that is universally acceptable.

Something happened in Zimbabwe that should make every politician consider how we can prevent the demoralising effects of power - among ourselves also.
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

My second point relates to the functioning of the Euro-12, which must be improved, but not by reducing further the current democratic deficit.




Mr President, now that all the honourable members' wishes have been voiced, I feel we must resolve to make urgent changes to the way in which the implementation of the MEDA programmes is organised.
The European example of the gradual creation of area without internal frontiers is being called upon to serve as an example in this instance.
If this is the aim of the report, I would stress that it should rather be interpreted as rationalisation to avoid wastage in social security benefits, for if they were administered more efficiently it would not be necessary to continually cut benefits and the pensions of the elderly throughout Europe.
It is a shame that we have not discussed the enormous cutbacks and extensive privatisation in these areas.
We are also working very rapidly on the Barcelona Process and on African participation in the framework of association agreements seeking to create a free trade area by 2010.
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.


Amendment No 1 focuses on a well-founded decision on maintaining the ban.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting


I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.
Certain informal aspects may have been involved, but at present, formally speaking, Austria' s representations are being dealt with at Council Working Group level, at Council of Ministers level, and at the European Council which is to take place shortly.

However, such concerns seem far removed from this report, which is why I cannot vote in favour of it as it stands.

I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.

The level of aid will remain the same, only the source of funding will change, and no one can seriously maintain that aid is only good if it comes totally from the Community budget.


The first one is the need to address, within the Union, the impact of legislation on business.
This in itself is acceptable, but we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a technology which is continually being developed.
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!




I am very receptive to the idea of discussing this with interested parties in the framework of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport with a view to finding the solutions that will best serve the interests of books, reading and cultural diversity.




I should like to put two questions to you.
no, IMO.
However, it must be said that the objectives of the trans-European networks are the development of the single market and social and economic cohesion. I would like to make this very clear.


hi seb


I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.
We have had this office for humanitarian aid in the EU since 1992, and both evaluation reports - which form the main basis of the assessment, together with the Commission's report - contain high praise for ECHO in respect of its work so far, while identifying several very serious weak points.
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.

cheat.. it has all the debian config utils i think


Let us begin, however, in a spirit of constructive criticism, by welcoming the fact that this contribution towards achieving better integration of the European scientific community seeks to safeguard the balance between fundamental and applied research in order to combat the brain drain, to prioritise the problem of unemployment among young researchers within a European policy which is aware of the reality of the situation, and to recognise the leading role played by businesses in research and development.
A few days ago in Strasbourg, President Nicole Fontaine herself made reference to all of the democrats of Europe, men and women alike, and especially the Basque Country in Spain, which, in her view, continues to believe in political dialogue, despite the climate of terror that exists.
We should not make the mistake of gambling away biotechnology' s chances, which is why we shall not be voting in favour of all the tabled amendments.
This applies, for example, to Amendments 7 and 8.
That is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile.
The Commission must be far more vigorous than it has been so far in putting the screws on those countries which have not established databases, so ensuring that the countries concerned become fully operational in this respect.

This report is another example of the EU policy of pulling up the drawbridge where immigrants and refugees are concerned.

We were against; the majority of the House - had they known of it - the rapporteurs - Mrs Redondo Jiménez and Mr Arvidsson and others - would no doubt also have been against it. But if we do this, then we must also show some degree of flexibility.


It is vital that resolute action be taken against retrograde moves and violations in the matter of human rights.

We at the European Parliament can still rectify this mistake made by the Commission by including an amendment to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s recommendation, which unlocks this source of information for the management of Community aid.

I wanted to point this out.
Let me end by saying that the EU mission was a high-profile one, very well received among the people in general to a point that would be the envy of several Member States, including mine, Mr Patten.

The proposed labelling regulation makes provision for the possibility of combining animals in groups rather than entering each individual animal with producers who take the trouble to guarantee the traceability of each individual animal given an incentive in the form of a special logo.



Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.
i dunno

I would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians.

Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mrs Read for all the work she has put into the present report.
However, for some technical reason, the services did not receive it.
I do not subscribe to the argument that Parliament should abdicate its constitutional right to improve this proposal because others have failed to initiate the legislative process in time.
She has put a great deal of work into it.
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.


I somewhat doubt whether any lengthy interview process was involved in filling the post in which Mr Levi did so very well.

We at the Committee on Development and Cooperation have every confidence that we can bring about this reform thanks to the agreements we have reached with the Commission.
Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children.
You have already identified some of the directives affected by this.
We are opposed to the areas of biotechnology focused on genetic manipulation or patenting the living organism. On the other hand, we are in favour of research focusing on sustainable technologies, particularly in the areas of the environment and health.

The North Korean leadership seems willing to be open and to pursue dialogue with South Korea, the United States, Europe and Japan, and although, in the final analysis, they must be judged on their actions, I am convinced that a European policy of dialogue, structured and critical dialogue, will make a significant contribution to changes in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that will benefit the entire world.
:)
I also have to say that open and frank discussions which sometimes address painful themes and touch upon sensitive issues are indispensable if we want to travel all the way down the path which lies before us.
I was involved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and I clearly recall the concept of real stabilisation which was proposed. In practice this meant reducing the amounts established.
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.

The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m.
This argument, which is both political and philosophical, is this: there is no equality without restrictions, and I challenge the Group of the European People' s Party to prove otherwise.


I wish you luck because I can already imagine the merry dance you will be led when you propose these measures: some Member States will request exemption, others will request an extension, for example for the spinal cord from 12 to 20 months, and others will claim to offer consumers safe meat.

well thanks guys , bbl.
The remaining areas, i.e. growth and employment, ETF, etc. have received continuous boosts, I grant you, but they concentrate on a few high-tech sectors alone, predominantly innovation, communications and genetic engineering.

The Summit conclusions state that "this system should include, in the short term, a clear and workable determination of the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application, common standards for a fair and efficient asylum procedure, and common minimum conditions of reception of asylum seekers" .
This demonstrates in retrospect that the concessions made to Turkey in Helsinki were perhaps premature and that the strategy towards this country, which is so important to western security, needs to be reviewed.


But he has said what this is all about.
Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating everyone who has been involved in the creation of this directive and especially those who have done the hard work of negotiating during the conciliation procedure, which I know has been hard, although I personally have not followed it - I followed the two readings, but not this third reading.
Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has been calling for the strengthening of the common fisheries policy on an international level as well.
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.
I have two final observations. Taking the appropriations for payment as a point of reference, in 2000 these totalled 1.11% of the gross national product of the Member States, but a lower amount is being proposed for 2001, corresponding to 1.0%.

I would like to thank you for your question, Mr Martin, as it gives me an opportunity to discuss an initiative recently taken by the Portuguese presidency in Romania.



In my opinion, we need to go further than the Council stated in its common position.
It did in fact produce results and paved the way for democracy in the Balkans.
If it were in fact to be accepted, then any restriction at all upon the use of dangerous chemicals, not merely in toys but also in foodstuffs and other products, would be prevented.
Both mergers and state aid must be controlled and approved in the future.

A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed.
All the Member States report any irregularities to the Commission, but only a few Member States tell the Commission which of these cases are classified as fraudulent.
hi
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.
The Commission made a clear assessment of this issue.


Mr President, the UN Commission on Human Rights is not just a discussion forum but also an exceptional instrument for the dissemination and defence of human rights.

Report (A5-0205/2000) by Mr Piétrasanta - MEDA (annual report 1998) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission report: Implementation of the MEDA programme - 1998 annual report [COM(1999)291 - C5-0117/1999 - 1999/2120(COS)]

Mr President, I want to preface my remarks by saying that whenever there is lack of respect for children' s rights, there is violence.



It will be a key figure in the discussion of financial matters that we shall have with you and the Member States when the time comes.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report is based on an initiative by the French Republic concerning third-country nationals, who are holders of what is called a national long-stay visa; in other words, one valid for no more than three months, which has been issued by a Member State of the Schengen area.
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.
The proof of this is the fact that in recent months there have been an increasing number of declarations, beginning with Heads of State such as President Campi of Italy, President Rau of Germany, prominent European politicians such as Helmut Schmidt, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Delors and more recently, with great success, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Fischer, all of whom have related the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference with a debate which is of importance to all of us, that is, 'where is Europe heading?' .

The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.

It is extremely important to reach an agreement over this issue, but even more so to reach an agreement of substance.
There are already horizontal measures in place guaranteeing equal access for organic bananas from third countries and organic bananas from the Community.

2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	LostMonk	i just did
I should ideally have liked to see aid reduced immediately to the aid level for cereals, but I can happily live with the Commission' s proposal.
This is your first presidency, and your Ambassador - if I may say this in public - has very nicely compared a first presidency with losing one' s virginity.

That is why I think we should prescribe less detail.

So I guess it's so you don't flood?
How can we demand that those countries wanting to join the European Union apply Community laws if Member States are themselves unable to respect them?
I wonder if the Council of Ministers can provide examples of any such concrete questions from the discussion in Euro-11 which have led to a new policy' s having been created.
We call on everyone in positions of responsibility, and now above all Kosovo Albanians, to ensure that when the occasion arises their compatriots behave in a restrained manner and prevent this sort of conduct against minorities.


Furthermore, are you able to tell us how the European Union and its partners categorise China? Do you class it as a developing country or as something else?

This is all about the credibility and the effectiveness of the European Union around the world.
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.

Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.

The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.

I want to point out in relation to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community institution has drawn up on globalisation in fisheries, and therefore I think our Committee has hit the nail on the head with the two own-initiative reports it has decided to produce; the other one is still in progress.
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.
And if there is less of a chance of catching BSE now than there was a short time ago, then it is thanks to our work here in Parliament and, I freely admit Mr Byrne, it is also thanks to the work which you have done.

Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.


This is why information campaigns are essential. After all, Europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle.

Greater involvement is needed in political actions, in the training process and in the administrative process in general.



We have managed to harmonise the European economy, but the current rail network is not a useful instrument for the single market.


Governments held to democratic account generally take more trouble over the welfare of their people.
I can see the Council representative writing busily and I hope that this will also be passed on to the Presidency and the other members of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
Delays of this kind, which might perhaps be explained by the trade agreement being negotiated in parallel, never fail, however, to amaze me.
We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe.



Consequently, the IGC must not be the instrument of a reform which will turn the Europe of tomorrow into a technocratic monster, ever more ignorant of the peoples' legitimate concerns and of the opinion of the national parliaments that represent them.







For example, we can build up public confidence by banning the creation or use of GMOs containing antibiotic-resistant genes and by providing agencies and the general public with detailed and objective information.




We are in the process of creating something completely new.
I am Austrian and yet as a European from the adjoining area I obviously also wish us to proceed together on this.
hehe
The next item is the report (A5-0078/2000) by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on electricity from renewable sources and the internal electricity market (SEC(1999)0470 - C5-0342/1999 - 2000/2002(COS)).
It is also disliked by the pro-immigration pressure groups whose influence is apparent in the explanatory statement which highlights the positive contribution of immigration and rejects a supposedly repressive initiative.




The problem involves the preservation of Parliament' s capacity to respond to this type of situation.



I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.



The laws in force provide for the right of residence to be revoked if there is a break-up in the matrimonial household, effectively outlawing divorce, and, as has just been said, homosexual couples are still not recognised.
Mr President, the PPE-DE does not support the resolution of the British delegates and has announced that it is to withdraw it later on, not because we would not want to condemn the increasing violence as a result of football matches, but because the resolution is too restrictive and insubstantial as it stands and, to that extent, does not belong in this Chamber.
I just wish to add two points.
Since the present Commission took office, six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1.
You see we are not under any illusions!
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.
) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports.
Nevertheless, the 30% introduces and establishes the principle of a 'no special fee system' .

Finally, I already said that Europe is expected to play a pioneering role.

Therefore, I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution.


My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.

In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.


These regions must be able to prosper on the basis of their own potential.

After all, what we want is to modernise the railway sector by means of competition, so that, ultimately, more freight is transferred from road to rail. This is because it is absolutely vital, on environmental protection grounds, to get freight off the roads and onto the railways over long distances.
From this point of view, we must be sure to keep a firm hold on strict conditions when licensing railway undertakings.




Nor is it a mere luxury.


Improving quality must not only be directed at Community legislation but also at the legislation of the Member States.

Because of your stability-oriented policy, the countries in the euro area can boast a historically low level of price inflation.
Furthermore, it is not acceptable that we have to endure a campaign of provocation, threats and insults not only by members of the Austrian Government, but also by the political forces which support it.
"Degrading" acceding countries to second-class members does not do them justice and has unwanted political consequences.

The Council, which recommended discharge for the Commission, included the question of shared management in its debate on the 1998 budget discharge and the proposal was mooted that the Member States should perhaps set their own objective for reducing shortcomings in the implementation of EU funds, an interesting proposal.




I am concerned at the wisdom of putting 30% of the appropriation into the reserve for security services as the rapporteur proposes.

A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?
However, to become a reality, the Rome Statute must be ratified by 60 States.


We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.

We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded.







It is not just the cows that went mad, and as a result, ovine scrapie spread to bovine animals in the form of BSE.
What is more, the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful.

If we can achieve this, then we will have globalised an important environmental principle.

The owners - that is to say the United Kingdom Government - and the employees of Sellafield have legitimate interests which quite simply cannot be swept under the carpet.

The Council regulation of 1995 perhaps focused in too exclusive a manner on the protection of tropical forests and not sufficiently closely on the harnessing of their productive potential.
The next item is the report (A5-0135/2000) by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision for the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 (COM(2000)274 - C5-0226/2000 - 2000/0110(CNS)).
We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning.
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.
The third area of incoherence is human rights.

In addition, it has made accusations concerning development and environmental activities by Greece in the areas in question, many of which are funded by relevant European Union programmes.
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.
I therefore support the remarks made by Arlindo Cunha and Rosa Miguélez Ramos to the effect that both the Council and the Commission must attempt to adopt a more dynamic approach in their dialogue with the Moroccan Government.

I think that is a huge success.
We are often glibly told, rightly in fact I believe, that we are moving into a knowledge-based society.
The Council of Europe, in its report Coherent and Integrated Family Policies, states, "Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values, standards, customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong" .


Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people?



With regard to ordinary passenger cars, we suggest that the limit is reduced by 2 decibels.

I owe you an apology, Madam President, because I suspect you do not have in front of you the view of the rapporteur on all of the different amendments.
If one is being kind to this directive one could describe it as being good in parts, like the curate's egg.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a series of amendments whereby Parliament is to call upon the Member States, and not the Commission, to implement the necessary cooperation in consultation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe.
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.







yeh
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.

The European Commission should not advocate more selectivity in dealing with cases which may give rise to an infringement procedure, a proposal according to which the Commission could abstain from intervening in cases of limited importance, such as, for example, the mutual recognition of qualifications.

Such being the case, I cannot agree with those who claim that a policy of budgetary discipline has been observed in the drafting of this Budget. On the contrary, this Budget is uncommonly slack, and this will make it difficult to gain the approval of the general public.
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.

Things are as they are and we shall have to live with them, because tobacco farmers cannot reasonably be expected to be left standing out in the rain after 30 years' common organisation of the raw tobacco market.


Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.
For our part, while we are signing an important Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa, it does not seem politically acceptable to send a message of financial cuts.
Installs fine on a P3.  Also I know stock debian will install without this issue
Let me be equally clear, we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli civilians by Palestinians and by the recent executions of Palestinians.
In the case of Turkey it is different.
Mr President, this shows the folly of making policy on the hoof.

For that can only be to the benefit of future negotiations and future agreements which we will be negotiating and deciding bilaterally.
That is neither viable nor desirable, but a mixture of the pressure towards targets, combined with competition between effective renewable energy industries, seems to us to be the long-term approach we should all adopt.



The simplest thing is to talk about the inspection of lorries, which is what we are really discussing, and perhaps we should all think about not only putting the technical title in some of our regulations, but also, in brackets, the colloquial title or one that is more readily comprehensible to our citizens, a matter which I shall transmit to the services and which we shall consider with a view to the future.




Mr President, I must express major reservations with regard to the Atkins report as it bears the stamp of commercial interests concealed behind the best of intentions.


It is suitable that today the presidency should be manned by Mr Danielsson from Nordic Europe.

That being the case, instead of elaborating on these two reports, I should like to say a few words to corroborate the arguments behind them.


Obviously, when we reach a new agreement within the ICAO, the Community standards will be adapted to the new ICAO standards, which, in any event, will be better than those laid down in the present regulations.


It might have been better and made more sense to vote not to work on Fridays: in fact, I put it to you that to vote in a certain way and then act differently is a display of blatant disregard for our institution.
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.
In the circumstances I feel bound to say that I personally cannot give my support to Mr de Roo's Amendments Nos 3 and 4.
And finally, one of the objectives of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy is the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security.
What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation, also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe.
I thank the Commissioner, whose timing is very good and so is his idea of launching this debate.
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.
At the same time, as we agree with many of the rights targeted for inclusion in the Charter which, by the way, are part of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, we decided we could not vote against the report, although we do think the set of rights under consideration could and should unequivocally include the social domain, as would be ensured by approval of the amendments tabled along those lines by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.

However, there are also some unfortunate gaps in it.
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.


In our opinion, on this occasion, it might be appropriate for the Union to adopt an initiative, a practical initiative which is a priority objective with set time frames.
There are four more sister ships in service at present.

In the fight against fraud and the careless handling of European monies, we must rely far more on cooperation with national parliaments.
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.


However, this alteration of the financial perspectives must respect the maximum limits contained in the guidelines on the financial perspectives for an enlarged Union with 21 Member States, as indicated in Annex II to the Interinstitutional Agreement. This clearly depends on the results of the accession negotiations.
In my opinion, on the subject of topical and urgent debates, as we have often found, it is not a matter of the extent to which we agree or whether to deal with this or that subject but of how to deal with it, and it sometimes happens that some of us consider that certain debates or resolutions should be dealt with in a more appropriate context, so to speak.




It is no mere chance that on the next day Turkey' s leaders declared that Turkey has become a candidate for accession without attached conditions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this was an important debate which has acted as a real stimulus for the Feira European Council.
The government is not doing enough about it and so a resolution in Geneva would be both beneficial and necessary.

I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary' s report for trade policy.

So as I see it, we need a new definition of additionality.
For this they need confidence, and confidence only comes through openness and transparency.

That is why I can only urge you to follow the recommendation of our rapporteur, who is seeking not only to maintain this type of programme, but who is also taking a stand against the proposal of 50-50 cofinancing that the European Commission is putting forward.
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.
That is why I request that this report be postponed until Parliament' s next part-session.

During the Finnish presidency, substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information technology, and in particular the Internet.





A further two questions have also been raised, the first by Messrs Hughes, Schmid and Pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors.

She was not acting it, she was not pretending it - nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun.

India - and Commissioner Patten made this point - whose importance is often underestimated, has finally received the recognition which, in the light of its economic and political dynamism, it deserves.
Moreover, it should be stressed that the State must pay victims compensation on behalf of those responsible and then claim damages directly from the criminals.




So far, there has been no success in complying with what is also laid down in the Socrates programme and giving a special boost to groups that are weak in socio-economic terms.
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.
All in all, on this matter, as on other matters, it is only the nations that can attempt to take up this great challenge, primarily France, which is still the leading power on the Mediterranean coastline, by means of its Arab policy and its policy of establishing links throughout the French-speaking world.

Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging.
In the immediate future, it is essential that all the parties concerned refrain from any act of violence, either inside or outside Lebanon, and cooperate with the United Nations forces.

Moreover, every day, we become more aware of the need for a common legal system coordinating the different legal systems of the Member States.
Malaria and tuberculosis, both of which kill more than a million people a year, must assume new importance in our work to reduce poverty and ill-health.
Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya report (A5-0140/2000)


Rather, it is a matter of realising that the military problem has become a civilian problem and concerns the protection, for a long time after the operation itself, of the health and lives of civilians as well as soldiers.


But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.
The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster, and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts.

We know that and we would like the Commission to look into that.
tseng: I will put a PaX enabled kernel into universe when I finished the porting to 2.6.9
Before proceeding to the explanations of vote, I have a series of points of order.
Permit me though, on a final note, to say something that is fundamental to the future of education, since I have just come from an educational symposium, the Federal Conference of the Austrian People' s Party.
Although differences exist between Member States, it is surprising that, over time, the logistical resources for analysing and eliminating meat meal or risk-containing material have not been found.
mike me tpp
It is high time that the European Union spoke very clear language.
We ought also, in the interests of reaching agreement with the Council, to see to it that we, as far as possible, relinquish what is of less importance.

This will depend very much on the subject and activity from case to case.


I know that in making these points I risk being demonised by the media and falling into the trap some sections of the report are setting for those among us who still dare express their opinion in the face of the exaggerations on which Baroness Ludford' s report bases what it sees as a rise in racism and xenophobia.

If there are records of offenders, it must be possible to keep records of victims.
The Council has demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Commission.
This timid IGC 2000 can in no way represent an end result, but only the first step towards a constitution.
This, meanwhile, would have very serious consequences for the whole of European agriculture. It is high time we showed ourselves to be credible and mature trading partners, as waking up to the realities of the present will accord with our real interests in the long term.

I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person.
I'm just curious if anyones been working on trying to get enlightenment 17 working in ubantu?
I studied this report from my standpoint as a mayor because the Commission proposal mainly reinforces current legislation on the incineration of municipal waste. As an aside, this shows the usefulness for an MEP of being able to exercise the complementary mandate of mayor which is an option that the current French Government is unfairly and absurdly planning to prohibit.
The report on its application, four years on, referred to Parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem.
Of course, for a less problematic country than Turkey, the very fact that the European Parliament intended to take an interest in the matter would be incentive enough to put a stop to any thought of violating its legal and moral obligations.



Many of the tragedies of the twentieth century in Europe have resulted from ignoring this wise advice.

If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Lest this should get out of hand, my appeal would be for a calm assessment of the matter, to make an evaluation and find a way forward.


Georgia fears that it will become isolated.
We could go so far as to say that at least 75% of the Members of this House are affiliated to organisations which are not clandestine, certainly, but do not have legal status, and demands are continually being made of us, which we try to respect and comply with, by the Court of Auditors, a key institution within the European Union, but which must not be the institution which in reality establishes the legal framework.

When they see a budget of EUR 965m, the newspapers will easily deduce that is over EUR 1.5m per Member.

I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer and also to wish him well for the Swedish Presidency.
We support the good timing and the reasoning of the issues raised by the authors of the oral question and we agree with the comments that have already been made here.
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent at the European Parliament, considers that the Commission, Parliament and the Council should change a major part of the fisheries policy and calls upon them to do so. The section in question is the part which refers to the now established practice of fishing the waters of other countries and then relieving our conscience by paying a sum of money to the governments whose waters we have fished.

The problem is that it does not work.

I hope Parliament, in amending this directive, will do so in the light of sound scientific advice, not as a knee-jerk reaction to tabloid newspaper scare stories.
tseng: s//?/

We here in Parliament have discussed this situation, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I am involved in the discussion of the issue, is looking into whether Parliament should possibly take the Council to court on account of this decision, which is a clear violation of Parliament' s rights, and weakens our citizens' already barely attainable rights of access to documents.
I am very fond of him.


Juan Garza's death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico, which he was never charged with.
A few weeks ago I visited Mexico for a number of reasons, one of which was to find out what Mexicans think of the new framework for relations between their country and the European Union, announced with great fanfare in most of the media.


Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.

Mr Schulz should be aware of this.
The New Democracy team within the European People' s Party has always vigorously supported the policies needed so that Greece, which was outside the first round of Member States, could honour the obligations needed in order to join the euro zone.
It is a common-sense balance between, on the one hand, protecting consumers and, on the other hand, ensuring that those same consumers have access to the low prices and wide choices that are available with the truly competitive market.



good luck :-)


Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.

It is what you might call a great inspirational strategy which proposes that Europe put all its effort into the new economy, into information technology and into telecommunications in the hope that, as this new economy develops, the old economy will take a new direction in its wake.
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.
They have contributed to a climate of Euroscepticism where there is no room for compromise.
The Council will then re-examine the situation.


But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.
It is clear that the area in which most improvement to the regulation is needed is that of pools.




This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.



Simira: I've seen tollef's pics..
I did do so and I do so again.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have debated the media in Serbia; we have been discussing this matter for years.
We have, slowly but surely, made tremendous progress in this field, but this does not seem to be evident from the way we are dealing with the funds.

With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe, we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which, of course, is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade.

But one which is still there in point 4 of my report, which I would like to underline, is the part that condemns any internal discrimination practised in Member States.

No solutions are contemplated, although I do not see why it should not be perfectly possible, in a European Union which will have 450 million members, to have 455 million.

Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat.
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.
And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted, stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations.


The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.
ah yeah dot slash configure before you make wood1

It lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Member States in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied, which, as I mentioned in my previous intervention on the Katiforis report, have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the European economy.


This depends on what you mean.



All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.

I would like to end by quoting an aphorism from Chairman Mao' s Little Red Book - which, although it is no longer popular can still be useful on occasions. It reads: "Do not give a fisherman fish; teach him how to fish better" .
They are thus parallel processes, with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other, and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue.
In particular, the important thing is to enable real development in these areas, while respecting the culture and traditions of the inhabitants, without setting them in stone in a purely passive ecological conservation mode.

The present situation is in fact far from ideal.
I regret that people in Austria have allowed themselves to be ruled by emotion, not rational scientific argument.

As the Commissioner rightly says, the burden deserves to be shared.
ogra, seems like someone here did something different to get it working, but I'll try that.



Having said this, the vote count in many regions showed an excess of theoretical votes in relation to the first round, which is completely impossible given that there were no longer any opposition candidates.

I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come before you here today to make a statement on European Patent No EP 69 53 51 which was granted by the European Patent Office to the University of Edinburgh on 8 December 1999.

As I understand it, the salto mortale of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could be interpreted as a declaration of support.

Even there, consideration might be given to going further by introducing a situation in which dominant operators become responsible for hiring out the telecommunications companies' premises for the purpose of housing equipment.

I would like to ask you if there has ever been consultation within the Council to tighten up this code of conduct or to make it more easily enforceable?




With regard to your question about this disagreement between Parliament and the Commission, it is obvious that the Council would be the last institution to get involved in this disagreement and will leave those two institutions to sort out this potential argument between them.
It can in no way be used to explain the positions of governments or the sensibilities of certain countries.

We have heard nothing about support being provided to all practical trials involving the public-minded use of new information technologies by the general public, nor about the role of associations for learning and information being promoted for all sectors of society.


We produced a communication in 1998 on this subject.
That is a more reasonable system. That, too, is a step forward.


In some organisations of the market, we have at least managed to grant special terms to newly established farmers or young farmers.
This is not a trivial question.

Technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles

That is how rigorous we believe we need to be but it will not detract from our support for approval of this agreement.
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.

There, it is far easier to portray the terrorism and executions committed by Palestinians, along with the claim that Palestinian children are sent into battle.

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always maintained that the intergovernmental method, which excludes elected Members and does not allow public debate, is a very significant weakness of the reform of the Treaties and a substantial barrier to its success.
I would, however, like to emphasise three statements that the Commission will make when it adopts the directive.
This seems all the more surprising because every few pages the Commission document reiterates the idea that efficiency demands an overall strategy.



In that way the information society emerges as a bubble economy, a symbol of social inequality and imbalance.
At the same time, however, we would emphasise that it is in practice impossible to separate desirable civil intervention from unacceptable military intervention.
If multiplied by the number of countries in the European Union one can see and understand just how important this industry is to our economies.



This is a case of negligence on the part of the Member States in putting these matters and the system into effect.
Progress in communications effectively increases the rate of dissemination of knowledge, as the development of the Internet demonstrates, and is a powerful factor in promoting economic growth.



Once we have a four-day week for everyone else, because the self-employed already work whenever they want, then we can also say that a session week is only four days long.
That makes no sense, as the electronic database on which traceability depends is not yet up and running in the majority of Member States.
I think it is high time account was taken in the Treaty reforms of our determination to insist finally on a status that makes us masters of our own procedure, and masters of our own decisions as to the seat and meeting place of our institution.

The PPE-DE Group supports the motion for a resolution tabled by several groups in the European Parliament.

I have a rough idea of what is happening in the country.
This means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard.
You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty.


Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks to the Commission, to Commissioner Reding and to the members of all the relevant parliamentary committees for their wholehearted cooperation, and also to the Council under the Portuguese and now the French presidency for their cooperation during this stage of the legislative process.
The idea - at the request of most group Chairmen - was that the four rapporteurs would speak first, and then the representative of the Commission would follow.

During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.

The main objective is to limit emissions of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and ozone precursors in order to improve the protection of the environment and human health against adverse effects from acidification, soil eutrophication and tropospheric ozone.

As for funding these two measures, that is a very difficult question, because it really is a problem for the Commission to be constantly confronted by the Council and Parliament with their wishes as to what it should do and where it should help; but unfortunately no-one tells the Commission where it is to get the money from.


Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Skinner for his commendable report on this complex issue of health and safety requirements for the use of work equipment, and also for being willing to adopt important proposals put forward by the PPE-DE Group.
What we have here is an attempt, when we see that a particular theory of monetary control is not working and does not accord with reality, to squeeze that reality back into the theory, to the detriment of the innovatory capacity of the Member States and of their financial systems.
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.

I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no intention of duplicating within the Commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the Council.
Mr President, I would like to concentrate on three issues in this debate on the preparation of the annual human rights conference in Geneva, and the European Union' s role in this.


For this reason, it is a step in the right direction when the Commission seeks so-called operational compatibility within the railways sector.
It cannot be fair for citizens to be left without protection against abuses by institutions resembling police forces, such as OLAF and Europol.

My understanding from the interpretation was that the incineration of dead animals is not covered by this directive under the terms of Article 2(2).
We are, therefore, taking a great step forward today.



I offer as an example our Objective 3 partnership's development of a tool kit for gender mainstreaming in structural funding.


In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.

Late payments are a breach of contract even when it is the Commission which is late paying.

Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.


For some time Parliament, the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep.
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.

There must therefore be some mistake here, either in the simultaneous interpreting or in the register of votes.


We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.
get xine
As I see it, in taking these three essential steps, we are already breaking down the national, fixed railway structures and creating new possibilities for competition between the railway undertakings.
The CAP and Structural Funds are the areas where most mismanagement problems lie in the EU, partly due to the scale of the finance received by these areas.
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.

I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process.
Pakistan should be asked to put a stop to infiltration of paramilitary personnel crossing over from their side of the line of control.




I shall be very happy to do that.
The key to success lies, to a very large degree, in the credibility of the environmental and consumer groups and in the good opinion in which these are held.
Mrs Hieronymi, furthermore, has been very open to all suggestions and it seems to me that, in relation to other programmes, it contains an innovation which the Commission has also contributed to, that is, support for marketing and distribution.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.
They have therefore shifted the responsibility over to Brussels, which is now forced to do their dirty work behind closed doors That is the real job of Europe today.

Mr President, the pregnant mother and her unborn child, mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period, which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society, remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in Europe today.

Its arrogance in relation to its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents also cannot be tolerated.
Without doubt, one of the consequences of mergers and takeovers is the effect on employment and I know that the Commissioner, within the confines of the Treaty, is sensitive to this.

And, again, as far as I am aware, this document is valid.
There were UN resolutions that called for a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir all that time ago, and still nothing has happened.
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.

He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that.
The European air management programme, whose purpose is to achieve complete coordination and integration of ATM systems at European level, must also continue to be expanded under Eurocontrol. The programme must be continued, because the problem lies not so much in the way air space is divided up, which could perhaps be justified in terms of ensuring that there is an appropriate number of aircraft and routes for each controller, as in the technical harmonisation of ATM systems.

Lastly, in any case, in addition to this aid for renewable energies, which I believe is essential and is put forward not just as a statement but as an objective - and remember that for the first time concrete objectives tailored to each individual Member State are being proposed, and this is being done in the green electricity directive - I consider it vital to maintain support for research in the nuclear sector, especially into matters of safety, storage and waste treatment (because burying it is not a solution), or into alternative issues such as the fusion system.

But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet.

Overfishing reduces stocks, catch sizes and revenue, and is the main threat as far as the future of resources and the fishing industry proper are concerned.

It is a clear problem that we need to address.



These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.


you need to mention that you're using icewm then :)
Mr President, MEDA represents the practical implementation, the instrument of our Euro-Mediterranean policy, as defined following the Barcelona Convention in November 1995, followed by a number of forums, particularly those in Malta, Naples and Stuttgart.

When he then mentioned the fact that the EU should have its own identity on the world stage, I thought: I would love to share this objective with him but in a way which would take account of European responsibilities.
The Spanish Government, for example, would like a European arrest warrant to be established.
We were right to turn our food aid policy round. We should not send our surpluses there but examine whether anything can be bought locally.

The second point, which is also quite important, is that, as I have already mentioned, we must gradually arrive at a system for internalising external costs, i.e. they must be considered for road and rail side by side.
It is not a satisfactory way of proceeding for Members to be here late at night, making very critical points and receiving a non-response of this nature.
I think we should place greater emphasis on Mediterranean policy, based on the diptych of democracy and development.
I am sure that we can count on the support of the incoming Swedish Presidency in the first six months of next year.

I would like to concentrate here on the application of the precautionary principle and on the difficulties in this case of dealing with an issue on which scientific considerations are confused and mixed up with emotional considerations, as well as a long history of disagreements between the industry of PVC and its derivatives and the environmental lobby, which, of course, is also deeply involved with this issue of phthalates.


I sincerely hope that Members of this Parliament will have the chance to act as observers, as these elections must be seen to have been free, fair and transparent in the atmosphere of fear that President Mugabe has created.

Mr Alavanos said that until now all the questions we have heard have been Greek.
ok

It would, in my view, be incorrect - and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself - if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which, although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age, should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive, according to a number of delegates.
All of us who love books, both as readers and writers, must rethink our relationship with books from square one.
And it is only by maintaining import quotas that we can achieve this objective, which is perfectly compatible with World Trade Organisation rules.
The goal of closing as many negotiating chapters as possible with the candidate states over the next six months, is a worthwhile one.
anir: I didn't want to sound harsh or impolite, but I really do not understand your problem...
There is no strategic plan, particularly in the Council.
B5-0078/2001 by Mr Sakellariou and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the ratification of the Treaty of Rome to establish the International Criminal Court.

The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.
It is quite evident that there is a problem, but if we start issuing ultimatums then the next thing will be that a delegation will arrive representing displaced persons and demand that the Czech Republic can only join the Union if the Benesch Decrees are withdrawn.

Mr President, I shall try to answer the questions as briefly as possible, although the brevity of my answers does not reflect the Council' s genuine desire to give answers to this House that are as comprehensive as possible.

To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.

Marble2, By the way, you should do a search in synaptic for xmms.. there are lots of plugins for it :)

I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme.
At the very end of the day, Turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice.

I have been disappointed by some aspects of the report's focus.
For this reason alone and, most importantly, in order to protect human health and the environment, all those responsible need to radically rethink the matter post-haste and these reports make that clear.
Mr Pannella, let me reassure you straight away. The quaestors are not lacking in common sense, believe me.

Madam President, as the low turnout during the most recent elections has shown, "Europe" as a concept does not mean a great deal to its citizens.



It must, of course, be said that, despite the good policies of equal treatment and equal opportunities which have been developed since 1975 by the Community and, above all, despite the well-intentioned recommendation of the Council in 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process, progress towards these objectives is slow. It is moving at a snail' s or a tortoise' s pace rather than at the speed of a racehorse.

This would be a great disappointment.

We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.

the need to simplify and integrate legislation affecting young farmers.



Perhaps it is a bit early to discuss the fifth directive now but I should like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Rothley that in any further legislative work in which this Parliament would like to engage, the Commission will take the same constructive attitude as it took with the fourth directive.
But we do understand how difficult and how complicated the issue will become if we have an extensive ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion, for example in education.
They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry.

A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.

This lack of planning can be seen in the programmes of aid for health and nutrition, and gender issues are also ignored.
Firstly, the incorporation of new countries, which means that the countries which currently benefit from the Cohesion Fund may find that they will no longer be in receipt of those Funds before they have achieved the objectives of real convergence.


This is obviously an extraordinarily large step in the right direction.
It contains an interview with a Corsican terrorist under the headline 'Armata corsa: menace terroriste sur Paris et Strasbourg.'



This Vitorino plan is what we need: clear, precise projects with a clear, defined timetable.


Although we all know that the European Union is not a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the same article compensates for this by stating that the European Union respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.



Very often you need to use a number of instruments.
It appears that the infrastructure authorities were aware of the fracturing of the rail as early as November 1999 and a further report was made in January of last year. No remedial action was taken.
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.
Mr President, according to Mrs Schierhuber' s present report, if something goes wrong with a certain regulation in Europe, in this case flax, it is quite possible to ensure that that regulation can remain intact by means of new proposals.

Similarly, the European Parliament called in resolution Á4-0018/99 (C-153/1-6-99) for the Commission to propose extending the exclusive fishing zone to 24 nautical miles in order to guarantee a suitable decentralisation policy and protection for the interests of coastal areas.
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.

Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.

Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers.
I am, for example, thinking of regions in Europe which heavily depend on cod stocks and the decline thereof.
In the area of police cooperation, the Council adopted a resolution on 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications.
With respect to Mr Martinez I will only say one word to him - sludge.
Do you also not consider, Mr Byrne, that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview, i.e. carry out proper screening, by testing one animal in every five, six or ten thousand to be slaughtered, depending on the BSE status of the Member State?

The rapporteur is supposed to be the spokesperson for the parliamentary committee.

So reads Item B in the motion for a resolution we have before us.

So while the rapporteur supports companies, especially when faced with the difficulties SMEs encounter because of 'administrative obstacles' and complexities, I have considerable reservations about certain provisions in the final text.
In this regard, I will add two decisive points.
http://www.fastsum.com/press/md5-hash.php
I would remind you how difficult it was in Parliament to raise the issue of malpractice on the basis of the accounts of the Commission for 1996.
Rewop, xinerama is (I think) an extension for XFree/Xorg

It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment.

Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection.
The situation in Portugal is that 40 boats have remained inactive since December 1999 and if the agreement is concluded one day, many of these businesses may by then have become unviable.

We seem to have forgotten that, once upon a time, we paid as little as USD 10 for a barrel of oil.

When problems occur, and they always will, it should not be the job of the ECB to paper over the cracks and pull down the shutters.
But the traditional legislative approach to Community business is also sometime ill-suited to the fast changing realities in external relations.
In fact, we are cooperating with the Indonesian Government, trying not only to insist but also to urge them in a cooperative spirit to do what a government ought to do in handling a problem of this character.


There has been significant progress on a number of issues outstanding but it is clear from Mr Kuhne' s report today that there are still a number of issues to be clarified: the question of the calls for tender; the issue of the financing plan for buildings; the question of the security service for this House here, and not least the question which is raised under paragraph 15 of the Kuhne report, concerning personnel policy.

davybondo, did you add anything to your /etc/fstab file?

The minister in charge, Mr Sok An, recently claimed that the guiding principle behind this thinking was to maintain stability and peace in the country In other words, former Khmer Rouge members whose testimony could jeopardise current stability, need not be brought to trial.


The joint resolution is absolutely right in highlighting the considerable nuclear risks which the dozens of scrapped nuclear submarines of the Russian northern fleet constitute.
Everyone is aware of the dangers posed by two nuclear reactors lying on the sea bed.

Indeed, unlike the rapporteur, I wish to retain the crisis committee from the Commission proposal.
Having been in force for 40 years, Community competition law had begun to show signs of exhaustion.

The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.
So I throw myself upon the mercy of the House and wonder whether it would be possible to vote early, rather than to vote late, on the Atkins report?


Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments.
Basically, we must start to change the way we provide aid to agriculture in Europe.
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.

Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa.
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.
There URBAN II would only be a drop in the ocean; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop.

Madam President, Commissioner, for some time we have been observing with increasing concern an influx of vessels, which do not belong to NAFO, the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, into the North-West Atlantic.

The more multi-cultural it is the greater the transparency, and the more democratic it is the more open it likewise is.
Airlines' pricing policy must include the external environmental costs of air transport. The regulation of slot allocation must be reviewed according to specific environmental criteria, taking account of noise and emissions into the atmosphere, and specific actions should be taken in order to strengthen intermodality with other trans-European networks, especially with railways, in light of the conclusions of the report on aviation and the global environment, which considers that more than 10% of European short-haul air traffic could change from air to rail.
We fully share the concern expressed in proposed Amendment No 4 but, as we already inform the budgetary authority of all financial and budgetary transactions under the terms of our Interinstitutional Agreement, proposed Amendment No 4 is in fact superfluous.

He has also promised that disciplinary action will be taken if they are not in fact fulfilling these, and I am very pleased about that development, but do not imagine that we shall forget you. Finally, I wish to say that I think it was a shameless attack which Mr Dell'Alba made on Mrs Stauner.
Blackwell, I see, firestarter is a iptables gui
Will we ever be able to say, we are putting an end to the embargo?

darn.  knew I should have lurked here.
I am all in favour of information and informed consumers who can make their own choices, but the labelling that has been proposed by the Commission does not provide information but, rather, a sharp warning.
However, the court judgement has put us in a position of inequality, because only the plaintiff can cite this judgement.
We welcome the fact that there will be a uniform definition and I support all measures to also place providers under obligation since today' s discussion can only be the start of a debate and of initiatives and is far from the end.



Provision is made, under Article 87 of this Community law, for damage - and I repeat, damage - which is the direct consequence of a disaster, to be made good.

Madam President, I want to mention the publication of a very important report a fortnight ago from the European Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment.


The positive results we hope for from the Intergovernmental Conference should allow us to proceed to the necessary reform of the institutions in preparation for enlargement.
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.
Under these circumstances, the pacifying declarations on humanitarian aid by the European institutions are shamefully hypocritical and we have no intention of backing them, which is why we abstained from the vote.

It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.
While they have succeeded in their aim of weakening still further the demography of western countries, they have not responded in a logical way to the more urgent question of protecting those women who are really in difficulty.

Arguably, the best way to combat drug trafficking is to dismantle the international networks for the distribution and laundering of dirty money.

It is clear that we continue to support this.
The second question concerns the role of the European Parliament, and it must be noted that, at present, it is too limited.
2005-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	Adrenal	trust me

I congratulate Mr Souchet in drawing up a good report in the face of Commission intransigence on this issue.

This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.
I see it rather as yet one more chance for peace in the Middle East.

Today, as twenty-five years ago, this question has divided this House to the point that my Group did not produce a voting list and group discipline could not be imposed, which I love in such a case.
All but two Member States send victims of the trafficking in women back to their countries of origin, in spite of the possibility that their lives may be in danger.

This concludes my general comments on the Funding Conference.
mitochondyu,  hmm ya to bad
It should also be noted that the Monitoring Centre on racism is based in Vienna, not least thanks to the commitment of the present Chancellor and then Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schüssel, and that we are proud to give a home in Vienna to this kind of institution that keeps a watchful eye on xenophobia and racism in all the European countries. For the Centre' s report indicates that no one country is immune from such tendencies.






The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it.
The example of Ethiopia illustrates that not only the purchase but also that the transport, distribution and preservation must be monitored very carefully and, Mr President, given that we were in Ethiopia, the orders had been placed, there were plenty of foodstocks, yet none of it was there at the right place or time of the famine, I do wonder whether we should not fine-tune our instruments.
I intend to chiefly focus on the proposal put forward by the Committee on Petitions that incorporates amendments signed by all of the groups in the committee.




This was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning.
Thank you for the follow-up question.



Everyone knows that some vessels even took advantage of the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika to discharge their waste at sea.
Many of you, ladies and gentlemen, have raised this issue.
For example, women are taking part in peace talks, improvement has been made in the field of women' s health problems, employment for women has improved in a number of countries and violence towards women has been put on the agenda in a number of countries.
It is, however, extremely important, because the treaty from the Rome Conference is the first international agreement that establishes that rape and forced pregnancy can be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Mr President, our Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left entirely shares all the considerations and proposals regarding nuclear submarine accidents, which are a sad legacy from the Cold War.
We have been summoned to debate four major reports to do with the common fisheries policy and its future.
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted against Amendment No 7 because we do not feel that a reference to the supposed 'Echelon' network is appropriate to this report.

Just one more example: last Sunday the Basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote.
European parties, let us not kid ourselves!



We are still within the 20% margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it.

As cooperating states we can do this, as a single territory the evidence suggests that we cannot.
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.





He must rectify what could have been avoided.

I nonetheless believe that, if we persist, we shall achieve what we have pledged.
lol
Last year, this Parliament was consulted twice about the establishment of a system for comparing fingerprints.

At the moment, information and communication technologies are crowned with all the virtues.

Large-scale pollution of the sea and the destruction of the animal life caused by shipwrecked tankers always attracts a great deal of attention.

If only today we were able to hold on to that great value of global culture that is dialogue, without prejudice to the greatest strength of our democratic convictions and the outright rejection of terrorism, and do so despite the latest painful, sad and abhorrent murder, even during the most difficult times and in the face of our most stubborn and murderous enemies.

A maximum of 5 million seems very reasonable to me.

Mr President, I voted for the Randzio-Plath report on the distortion of competition where public undertakings are concerned.
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.

It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results.
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.

Mr President, I would like to say that this directive, which is being prepared in collaboration with other departments and other Commissioners, such as the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Competition, is still being developed. I will be able to give you a more complete text at a future sitting.

I therefore appeal that the target which the Committee has set itself, i.e. of establishing the age of 18 as standard at European level, be implemented as soon as possible.

Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.

In which language is it to operate - in Spanish, English, French or in the languages of all the Member States?
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.
In the report on the adoption of the single currency by Greece, I blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done.



The wild birds directive is little better with 13 countries currently facing a legal challenge for failure to comply with the directive 20 years after it was agreed.
I am not in any way opposed to further harmonisation, it can be helpful to the good functioning of the internal market, but imposed legislative harmonisation needs to be carefully and openly considered, or we may find we have left our citizens behind in this project.

Mr President, the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Evian has, in fact, already anticipated to some degree the excellent proposals in Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report.
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.
This means that if closer cooperation were included within the Second Pillar, it would then be necessary to find a specific way of implementing this concept in this area. This could not copy the First Pillar given the dissimilarity between the operation of these two pillars.

These are in a way beyond the control and vigilance of everyone.
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.

If competitors were grouped according to age, in the same way that boxers are grouped according to weight, we could organise sporting events for people over 30, 40, 50 or 60 years of age.

With this proposal the Commission has also provided the necessary legal basis for adaptation of the lists of definitively and provisionally banned substances by the regulatory committee procedure in order to allow for rapid reaction to new evidence and thus further to enhance consumer safety.
The Commission is of the opinion that a horizontal approach is the most efficient way to guarantee a comprehensive responsibility regime for environmental damage.





To sum up, this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for anticipating industrial change.




I think it is rooted in common sense, and a very far-reaching sense of consistency.

In this decision it is important to avoid anything which might add to their workload and slow the process down, without allowing for the fact that the amounts involved are not vast and that if this decision for the year 2000 is adopted this year, that will not leave much time to prepare cofinancing requests.





Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is why the Council Presidency, and you can be sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, will commit itself to achieving this aim with the same determination as the European Parliament and the Commission.
The text also contains dishonest provisions in terms of labelling.
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.

This is a major task, but we are relying on you to see it through.
Since the drug wars started in the 80s, violence has increased in a terrible way in Colombia.






Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.
How does the Council envisage strengthening the role of labour and management?



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today' s debate, because it gives us an opportunity to voice a clear warning and to remind you of the political approach that we have adopted to Latin America.

We have set up a new crisis management unit to help pull together the Commission's contribution in that area, but I also want to adapt our structures so that we can have a greater input into aspects of external relations where traditional bilateral diplomacy has been less effective and where the Commission has particular expertise which it should be able to deploy more effectively.

Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.

Is there anyone in this Parliament unaware of the role played by these multinationals in financing American campaigns?

The directive therefore provides that, when an agreement mainly serves the purpose of procuring the debtor additional liquidity at the expense of the creditor or where the main contractor imposes on his suppliers and sub-contractors terms of payment which are not justified on the grounds of the terms granted to himself, such provisions may be considered to be factors constituting abuse.
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.

It is up to Commissioner Patten and the high representative of the Council, Mr Solana, to ensure that the European Union has a chance to distinguish itself as a successful international mediator in conflict situations.
I hope you will understand that I can support very few, because they no longer follow, in fact, they abandon the line which I presented in the Committee on Budgets and which was adopted by a majority in the committee.
We therefore propose, in order to defend Europe and the rule of law, the immediate rejection of this report.

Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.

Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.

Our democratic values, our common will to foster peace and security in the world and our history guide us towards such a role.
It is of utmost importance for our Parliament to be totally involved.
In terms of environmental impact, aviation uses less than 8% of the land required for rail and less than 1% required for road use.

This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.



A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.


These are not only two quite different goals, but it is also difficult to combine them in one and the same system.
I asked him what he thought of Energy Star and he replied that he thought it was a good thing.

Why would it not work elsewhere?

For Greece, as far as Turkey is concerned, there is only one issue which needs to be settled and that is the boundaries of the continental shelf in the Aegean.
As such, it is used to make tips to shells to increase their penetrating capacity.

Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.
Paragraph 3 of Parliament' s resolution of 18 June 1987 'Calls on the Council to obtain from the present Turkish Government an acknowledgement of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians in 1915-1917 and to promote the establishment of a dialogue between Turkey and the representatives of the Armenians' .
The amended regulation on preventive distillation will be published in the Official Journal in the near future and will be made retrospective to 24 February.
It is one of the duties of Europe, which has the task of being the driving force of a balanced system of trade, the market, development, growth and economic prosperity.
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam states that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, Greece is a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression and religious freedom.


Within that framework there is clearly a choice of instruments for putting the single market in place which can be described as the choice between harmonization and mutual recognition.

I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.

This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.


If there is any change to that, this Parliament needs to be notified far in advance of tomorrow.
It is a fixed-term agreement with an impact inside and outside schools, providing guidelines for educational practice as well as information for the public and serving as a planning instrument and a yardstick against which the development of a school can be measured.


Instead, we have from the outset stated our support for the establishment of a temporary committee on cloning and on biotechnological research so that we can hold the hearings necessary for adopting a position with a full understanding of the issue when the time comes.



I also wish to make a couple of points on the Kuhne report on Parliament's own budget discharge.
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.



We see no reason for extending majority decision-making into this area.

The police and judicial authorities of our respective States must therefore receive adequate resources to combat this plague which affects the most vulnerable of us. In this area which is cross-border in nature, it may be useful for the European Union to make its own contribution.
Corrections totalling EUR 249.8 million were made to refunds for the financial years from 1994 to 1998.
Incentives must be created so that, in order to take some of the pressure off the system, foundations can take over educational establishments and sponsorship can be broadly based.


If liability pertaining to gene food is not regulated now, suspicion among the public regarding this type of food will only grow.


We are being asked not just for a belt-and-braces policy but also to buy a new pair of trousers just in case. This would cost a great deal of money.

While we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the EC Treaty, the presidency made the European Union position clear in a final statement before the General Assembly.
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.

It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.
This dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on Tunisia's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two Association Councils that have taken place to date.
This has a bearing on the speed at which anti-discrimination can be translated into legislation in Europe and at which people can therefore be protected from racial or ethnic discrimination, and I do not appreciate the fact that Parliament is arguing in favour of postponing this protection.
That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist.

I wish to take this opportunity, Mr President - because lately these last minute rushes have become a regular occurrence - to say that the Commission and the Council are given considerable notice, a whole year' s notice, of Parliament' s timetable, which should give them - and us too - sufficient time to work on processing these proposals.

We sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope.

Children will switch to consuming non-nutritional products or, God forbid, we will move closer towards a situation where children will have to pay for milk consumed, thus discriminating against poor children from deprived communities.

Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.
After the terrible events over the last century none of us wants military conflicts.
We therefore have everything to gain from improving the accuracy of biological predictions, for example by certifying the drafting of these opinions.
What we want is to give women the opportunity to find their niche in decision making, politics and the world of employment in a normal way, with some help from society.

I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain.

I welcome Turkey' s signature of these documents as an important step in the right direction. However, I should also like to emphasise that it is now a question of both conventions quickly being ratified by the Turkish Parliament and of the commitments contained in these also being put into practice.
An important point, as Mr Watts has already pointed out, is safety. Nobody should compromise on safety.
Under the heading of trade, we find a repeat of several of the most dangerous points of the MAI (Multilateral Agreement on Investments).
A subsequent return of liberalism will come as no surprise.

It is true that these include projects in Objective 1 areas and cohesion countries, which has allowed the percentage of cofinancing to be greater.
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.

But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.


More particularly, I hope the existing bodies will be required to contribute to making industrial change increasingly transparent and, Commissioner, I hope the texts we are waiting for, on information to and consultation of workers, and the European company, will one day be submitted to this Parliament.
Why is the exercise before the Union of the powers of the national authorities, federal states and Autonomous Communities not recognised?
Despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter, it has been dealt with very fully in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled.
How do I transfer a file from Amsn to somebody from Gaim ?

To be honest, Commissioner, on reading the communication, I find too little account has been taken of sustainability, the question of ecological products, incentives for an ecological lifestyle or the question of the impact which I+C technologies have on environmental protection.
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	yann_	i'll try :)


As regards the specific instance of KEDO, let me remind you that in 1998 Parliament blocked the funds for that year, and it was only possible to overcome this problem by means of a compromise with the Commission, in which the Commission undertook to inform Parliament, at the beginning of each year, about Euratom agreements being negotiated, so that Parliament could consider them.
Following a complaint from the French association, SOS-Racisme, and faced with the threat of prosecution, the club undertook to end this behaviour and to no longer allow the hooligans into the stadium by strictly screening people as they enter.
2005-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	Crane	gentoo kicked my butt
I have to tell you that the agreement ceased de facto to apply 14 months ago, and that the Moroccan side was, unfortunately, not prepared to enter into serious negotiation on a new agreement until the end of October last year, in other words, just three and a half months ago.
In this respect, the Commission' s initiative is commendable.

Mr President, for years I have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed.
We have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things.
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.
There is also a vital need to create a single legal framework in the European Union to provide citizens with sufficient guarantees, essentially by preventing the improper use or dissemination of personal data and by remedying the shortcomings in the current system of protection.

However, we do not believe that it is appropriate at the moment to vote on a resolution, drawn up as we go along, which may create problems and be divisive.


If that is the case, vigorous protests are certainly needed so that we can bring about a change, for matters cannot continue like this.

This is clear enough, I think.

The mode of transport we are discussing here, short sea shipping, has the reputation of being a mode of transport which can counter the negative effects of the transport sector, especially in terms of the space occupied and environmental pollution, in more than one way.
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.
One aspect of this Framework Programme is its four thematic programmes, which define priority areas for research, and its three horizontal programmes.
These questions are useful to highlight some of the grave deficiencies in the legislative proposal on reforming the Treaties.

In other words, the Portuguese sites that already form part of the Natura 2000 network are completely at the mercy of unscrupulous groups of financiers and construction companies, because of the lack of instruments to protect them.
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.

We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report to the European Parliament on the results of summits is always an experience.


Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?
We shall now proceed to the vote.
In this way the European Union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing, measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made.
rolfzor: Alright.  Just let me see if I can find
The Commission departments have made such information available.

Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.
This is our determined aim, our goal, and we gave renewed expression to it in our resolution of July.

Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?


Freedom of the press in Serbia
I think I can announce the body of the conclusions today.
That is why the Commission was right to intervene.



Will users in the not too distant future be asked to pay for their electricity in advance, as is the case in Great Britain, and be forced to go without when their card runs out?





I do not know what the problem is, but there is a problem.
The said committee of inquiry accused the Belgian government, the authorities responsible that is, of being too slow to implement the system.




With the fifth and subsequent stages of the SLIM in mind, we are currently considering suggestions with regard to sectors which could be due an overhaul.



With regard to whether requests for the quorum to be tested are intended to sabotage proceedings, I would refer you to events in the Italian Parliament.
I do not think I abused my position.


Of course, the Roma have rights and should not be discriminated against, but many of them, and I am not saying the majority, but certainly a large number of them, as has been statistically proven, do not live lawful lives.

Does the Council believe that the present situation in Chechnya is such that it is reasonable to provide this aid to Russia?
Mr President, over one hundred years ago, European colonial powers divided tribal lands in Africa to establish national boundaries.

Following my lead, the Heads of State and Government agreed upon the need to clean up the Danube.
This is a positive step. Nevertheless, he accepts faster liberalisation of the transport and energy sectors, an increase in flexible working and the process of budget consolidation already under way, thus highlighting his own contradictions.



I begin by welcoming the Commission's proposal to integrate Europe's convention on a high-speed rail network.
And of course, at the other end of the spectrum, there are countries such as Greece and Italy, where the proportion of women is below or around 10%.
We will therefore continue to state our position to the Council, which is that we would have a win-win situation if the solution adopted were the one for which the Commission has always fought.

You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.
Mr President, the Commission' s proposal to reduce refunds for processed agricultural products and to make inward processing easier carries considerable risks. I shall highlight just three of them.

(DE) The Commission cannot accept Amendment 4.



Unfortunately, this philosophy, as can be seen from the debate, prevails not only in the Council and the Commission, but also in the European Parliament which, instead of expressing the feelings and interests of the citizens, is about to ratify an extremely dangerous policy for Europe and mankind as a whole.
Our view is that the generally accepted status of the Commission is still valid: it is the guardian of the treaties, equidistant from each of the Member States; it is autonomous, independent and the defender of the common good. It is the Commission rather than the Member States that is responsible - transcending borders and national peculiarities - for drafting laws that provide adequate protection on issues involving fundamental freedoms.
We must do everything, including under the financial programmes in the agricultural budget, in order to make it 20% or 30% cheaper to get animals to market, for example through sectoral agreements, otherwise we shall simply never get a grip on the situation.
Pozac: only with letters and numbers i think..






Finally, we would like the Commission to explain why at the recent ILO conference, the Member States failed to adopt the common positions. How is it possible that the United Kingdom abstained from the final vote, which, in view of the procedure, is tantamount to voting against?

That issue too is one of great concern to me because an area of Wales has been mentioned as a possible site for storing low-level radioactive waste.
Reallocation of resources is necessary, and consequently also reform of staffing regulations.


Well, it is not too late.
I am sure that we all agree on the strategic importance, which is crucial for the European Union, of its Mediterranean influence; politically, since, being neighbours, we are required to build a relationship which goes beyond the constitution of a simple free trade area; economically, because I am convinced that opportunities for mutual benefit are being created which we are not taking sufficient advantage of; also, socially, because the problems of the extent of economic inequalities and of the great pressures resulting from migration require coordinated and structural solutions and, of course, we also have to mention the question of security.
The first is the federalisation of the institutions, by making qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament the general rule, introducing transnational European elections, and strengthening the powers of the Commission in an attempt to turn it into a European Government.
Not only do those living near the airports complain, passengers too are dissatisfied.
We are, of course, one of the small countries which are always oppressed, but we should like to be able to watch Danish television so that we can keep up with what is happening. We are Europe' s most important country.
In the field of CFSP, notable progress is already being made, particularly in terms of cooperation in the area of defence.
As to Member States leaving the Commission to do the dirty work, I hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement.




gnome-system-tools, got it.
We also need to develop and strengthen the Schengen acquis as included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I do not want to recount my experiences at length, I just want to tell you what my impression was. It was one of disappointment.
Personally, I see it as an historic necessity and opportunity, which must not be put at risk either by rashness, undemocratic procedures, and bureaucratic or national small-mindedness, or politicians ' lack of consideration for the social dimension.
In our opinion, anything we can do in the field of development policy is but a substantial part of this foreign and security policy.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this highly informative report.
pitti: oh =/
Despite frequent promises by the Turkish Government, human rights violations continue there.
They are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well.
People will need to protect themselves against such abuse.
This report is also a reaction to the excellent communication by the Committee on new measures to fight trafficking in women.
We are basing our approach on a principle which is debatable, but without any evidence to the contrary I believe it can be demonstrated.
Secondly, growth and convergence with the other countries of the European Union may come to a halt in some countries.
This is particularly true when it is faithful to the guidelines and decisions of a European Council.
The old equal pay clause underlies a whole structure of equal treatment legislation which now forms part of the acquis communautaire.

The draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect, and our Group has therefore given it its full backing.

Blackwell: thus it is _everyone's_ job to encourage wiki and mailing list use

For me, that would actually suffice as a Commission position.

Nonetheless, even though progress has been made in recent years thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and complementary schemes such as positive action, they are still too few in number to be satisfactory.
We will examine questions to the Council.

I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.

usual, the October wallpaper  2nd from the top on http://brisgeek.com/etiquette/downloads.html  works best with the icon them I find
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.

What is more, at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Portuguese Presidency informed Parliament of the work being carried out and of the reasons why the Council deemed it urgent to continue with the procedure for the adoption of the strategy document.
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.

They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.

We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.
This trend looks set to continue, as the Federal Reserve has just hiked up its interest rates.
An important prerequisite for the EU' s active involvement in issues affecting human rights is good access to relevant information.



Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.


Firstly, the high level of responsibility of the Government itself, which covers up violations of human rights, torture, kidnapping and murders committed by paramilitary groups in collusion with the army.
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".
We stand here in moral indignation and are, at the same time, filled with a huge sense of powerlessness.
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.
However, thanks are similarly due to the Commission which has provided an outstanding basis for the discussions between the Committee and Parliament.
I would urge colleagues to accept my group's amendments on liability insurance, GMO contamination and the ban on antibiotic-resistant genes.
Secondly, we have put pressure on the Member States to meet their obligation to actually set up these port reception facilities. We have ensured that Member States will be required to introduce compensation measures, in case ships are forced to remain in ports unnecessarily, simply because there are no waste disposal facilities available, or they are inadequate.

However, it appears that we are not always completely sure which rights we are talking about and that we are introducing or we want to introduce rights which are not provided for in the Conventions or the international Treaties.



The Commissioners work for the whole of the Union and are, in fact, important if consensus is to be achieved between the Member States.



The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Meanwhile, measures are also being considered to facilitate private investment in these 12 countries, which in 1994 amounted to EUR 3 500 million, particularly by means of updating legislation and administration, as well as by means of meetings between companies belonging to the MEDA countries and the European Union.
It is not just a matter of pushing a cart; it is a quite exceptional field, because information is at present the most important tool of production.

We are aware that film production is dependent on aid, as it is a combination of culture and commercial production.
The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 38 and 49 concerning gene transfer.

And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.
Madam President, the constitutional questions we are debating today are highly controversial, as the vote in committee clearly shows.
(FR) In this report, we voted in favour of the paragraphs which contributed towards protecting the working women, both in terms of their health and wages and in terms of children' s health.
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.

The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.

I had also invited the chairman of your committee, Mr Hatzidakis, and Mrs Theato, chair of the Commission on Budgetary Control, to participate in this seminar.

As the Council President mentioned, following Helsinki, negotiations are now in progress with all the candidate countries.


That includes access to documents, not only for the citizens of Europe but also for the Ombudsman.
I believe that we should seek something acceptable, which would be a step forward, rather than reach a deadlock.
The Commission has also confirmed that if the two countries in question agree, it will support the inclusion of the line in the trans-European rail network when the guidelines for that network are next revised.

We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc.

The war has always been about controlling oil and in my view little or nothing to do with Kuwait.

The issue of Boliden' s liability in this case therefore remains a national issue which must be resolved through national environmental legislation.

It is a well-considered report and, as he said quite rightly, it is relevant to thousands of people.




Naturally, the Council has complete confidence that the new democracies in the applicant countries will more than cope with the challenges they may come up against.

As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.
It cannot be denied that the European labour requirements are constantly increasing, but, at the same time, we must put an end to illegal immigration and the numerous existing cases of illegal trafficking.
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.
Europe, and in particular the EU, should not be in two minds about this.
Parliament also seems to share the view that the main action has to be taken at the level of Member States.
It is not a matter of duplicating the installations or the research carried out in some European Union Member States but instead of developing, as Mrs McNally suggests, a shared system of technical and scientific references for political applications.
Nonetheless, the reduction of these noise or gaseous emissions must be limited to the commendable search for technical solutions that are to everyone's advantage.



I am of the opinion that the Fund should finance measures to inform the public concerning the policy and practice of the Member States with regard to refugees, asylum seekers and other temporarily protected persons.
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.
We want you to do so, and we understand that in that way we can support you so that you, who have just joined this Commission, can really control your house. 'Take the bull by the horns' - as we say in Spain - and we will be able to achieve a discharge for this year on the part of the majority of the Groups in this House before the summer.

Private sector provision has delivered the goods.
The Union, which is today in a position to do so, should draw up and implement legislation to this end.
Considering that this draft, as presented, infringes specific European directives, both the habitats directive and the wild birds directive, and also the objectives of the water framework directive, my question is this: if the final law still infringes these directives, if it is harmful to the environment, will it receive the announced EUR 1 300 billion in resources from Community funds?
Secondly, we really all think that after the meteoric rises in oil prices over the past year, in whatever way we want to convert and achieve a more fair and environmentally compatible system, the total charge for undertakings must not rise.

dunno. just installed ubuntu last hour or so.



. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to sincerely thank all those who helped me draft this report, and especially the committee members for adopting it unanimously.

I am convinced of the personal and political commitment of Commissioner Vitorino and the College of Commissioners to this undertaking, something that they have demonstrated on several occasions.
In this way our structural policy itself will contribute to regionalisation.

Thank you, Mr Galeote, for your contribution.


We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.
In countries which cannot incinerate, cattle are left standing in their stalls.

To say that they are extremely worried is an understatement.



It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once, instead of spending years discussing institutions, the European Union has put results before means.


Secondly, because of the hypocrisy involved in pretending to stand up for immigrants and minorities while conducting an anti-immigrant domestic policy, if only in the form of hunting down immigrants who do not have proper papers.
I can guarantee that all seven parliamentary parties in Sweden, especially my own Christian Democratic Party, are concerned about the matter.
Minister, you are in the fortunate position of being able to start your speech immediately.
It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe.
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).

I want to say once again that this is not a problem created by our staff, who work extremely hard, thin on the ground as they are.
Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions?

Short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this.
Commissioner, all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise: respect for human rights.
Indeed, we have supported it throughout the entire procedure.




Commissioner, I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas, so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market.

I would most earnestly ask my colleagues to stop trifling with this Parliament and withdraw their proposal - perhaps with the help of Mrs Buitenweg.

I think it was Mr McCormick who mentioned the problems that promoters at grass roots level had in implementing projects.


This situation is indeed very critical and not a normal, routine situation - but unfortunately it is what we are facing - and I feel an obligation to do my utmost to secure agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the proposed approach.

I should like us at some point, but not now, to debate the opportunities for creating framework legislation in this area.

These issues are major but they are limited in number.



We believe that the output of this mechanism will be available to support the decisions of EU institutions and EU partners and this could be done in a flexible way within the European Treaty.
It is correct that some Tutsi parties have used the risk of annihilation of the minority as an excuse to maintain their supremacy.

There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.


We also approved the inclusion of the right to protection of the diversity of European languages and cultures, especially the less widespread and less used national and regional languages, which also gives due recognition to the official languages of the autonomous communities and regions, like the Basque language.

Let us see them ratify it.
The Eurostat figures were also published this morning.
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.

It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .

They concern the proposal which seeks to draw up a list of ports which are particularly suitable for short sea shipping.


Others such as Luxembourg have implemented the bare minimum, and inevitably this has caused serious problems.
paulproteus: if he had asked how to open a console, i'd have thought about teaching him the gnome-specific way
From this viewpoint, the Morillon proposal is an encouraging prospect.



It is as much a taxpayer' s crisis as an energy crisis.
He has to leave the chamber at 7.00 p.m. and we must therefore try to be very quick and make a collective effort so that we can deal with the majority of the questions.
We also hope that these proposals are acceptable to the Commission, despite the fact that theirs - 25 million for the commitology question and 850.5 million for the budgetary framework - are somewhat different to the ones that we are presenting.
That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists.
As I have done on so many occasions in the past, I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles, as previously agreed by this House in February 1999.
I myself wish to raise the issue of peat, which is dealt with in the second paragraph of the report.
Are you aware, Sir, that the leader of the British Conservative Party has said that we have reached the limits of European integration?
Remember that the directive is not an effort directive, it is a result directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Council has adopted the European Parliament' s amendments on the labelling of beef products.

The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	bob2	Adrenal: lots of people choose linux over windows on it's merits, rather than because they have to

Mr President, the report by Mr Bouwman, which is the outcome of a long process, has in the interim become even more topical in France because of the shipwreck of the tanker, the Erika, on the occasion of which the Minister for the Environment did not see fit to interrupt his holiday.
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.
Many problems remain in the field of the recognition of qualifications.
Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so. No, we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here.
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)


Lastly, it is important to highlight another point too, which is of a more specific political-institutional nature.
Those who are rewarded in some way for undeclared work have no right to claim compensation at all and no other consumer rights.


im just gonna try it slower like it suggested

B5-0171/2000 by Mr Cossutta and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the rights of the Dineh people, USA;
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.
The Council and Commission have indeed supported the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, but these drafts still allow for the criterion of dual criminality in exceptional cases.
On the other hand it can accept Amendment No 8 and in principle the part of Amendment No 10 dealing with scientific data.
Report (A5-0162/2000) by Mr Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 1999-2000
i'd rather concentrate things there than -announce for the moment

However, this example should make us aware that it is not always a question of absolute power or authority.
Moreover, while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid.

Even if the amount is doubled or trebled in later years, it remains a joke compared to the many initiatives which can qualify for RRM action.
There is no way out for victims and the very nature of the environment in which they work often reduces them to despair and drug addiction.

Mr President, I would thank the Commission for its statement and would urge it to file an official objection to this patent.


In this respect, the euro systems monetary policy framework is well equipped to cope with such uncertainties.
He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action.
Every system creates its own type of failures.
Finally, with regard to the minimum requirements for social security, there is one possibility that we propose to extend to social security, which already exists for other areas of social policy, which involves adopting minimum requirements by qualified majority vote.
In his letter, he levelled heavy criticism at our Committee on Budgetary Control regarding the way it carries out its function.
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.

Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market.
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.

The report, as it was approved within the committee, is in my view a fine example of a document which has struck a fine balance between the interests of all parties, both small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers.
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.

Now, the first task must be to define at Nice certain priority issues referred to by President Chirac in his introductory speech, such as closer cooperation, the adoption of majority voting as the rule and the adoption of a decisive Charter on Fundamental Rights which will be included in the Treaties. This would be a basic step towards defining a European Constitution.



Given this situation, as the resolution we have presented indicates, we demand that the government of Equatorial Guinea initiate a genuine transition to democracy, which we believe could begin by making these municipal elections free elections.

If, on the other hand, we look, for example, at the issue of filling top posts - when it is a question of finding a new Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund - and see how the Europeans behave towards the Americans, then without a doubt we are still a very long way from this equal partnership.

The heart of the problem is political, however.
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.

How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.
In other words, according to these bankers I spoke to recently, the bottleneck is not so much due to the availability of capital as to the availability of entrepreneurs. This is tied in with the economic culture.

Last September it published a report stating that BNFL has high-quality management in terms of health, safety and the environment.

I cannot believe what is going on!
I shall end by saying that we must also devote ourselves to informing the citizens, in whom scientific progress raises as much hope as concern.
Mr President, I think it is a great achievement in human rights terms that we have succeeded in giving a signal with this resolution - a signal that it is not acceptable for embryos to be deliberately created for research purposes.

Well, due to a lack of competition as a result of excessively protectionist behaviour on the part of the Member States - and I am not ashamed to admit this - the train has been condemned to a second-class position even in this century, also in terms of technology and even durability, which certain Members have emphasised. Trains are not durable and they are no longer clean, especially the diesel locomotives.
Mr President, can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur.





Portugal is also very pleased that, in the last Social Affairs and Employment Council, a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life.

I know a guarantee has been given that the removal of this sum from the budget will not affect any of the financial obligations entered into by the Commission within the framework of the CAP, but I just do not believe it.

fabbione: hi


A prerequisite for relieving debts is sound financial housekeeping within the governments concerned.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our mind' s eye we can still see the tragic pictures from Mozambique, the results of a rare sequence of extremely harsh natural events. We are also very much aware of how slow the response to this massive disaster has been.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s excellent report, which we have before us, on the European Commission communication, "Towards a European research area" , has aroused genuine interest in the House judging by the fact that almost 150 amendments have been tabled.

I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.

There are a number of conditions present in Bangladesh that are not present in a number of other developing countries, in as much as Bangladesh - and this, I think, is very important - has only one language and one religion and consists of only one ethnic group, which means that the ethnic conflicts we see, for example, in Africa do not exist there. Nor do religious wars.


My distinguished predecessor Ms Bonino had something to say on the subject of enforcement.

In order to achieve this, it is also important to bear in mind that the regulations of the country of origin are fundamental, since, without them, small- and medium-sized businesses would find it difficult to operate and would encounter obstacles to achieving their objectives, because they do not have access to the same resources as large companies.


Finally, I would like to point out that it is not sufficient to map out and restrict the risks pertaining to these new production methods.
Here too it is my goal, under the 'value for money' maxim, to promote the overall productivity of the committee through a variety of measures.

I believe that these practices, as well as the possible substitution of the well-known national monopolies by a European oligopoly, should be combated relentlessly by the services which come under the responsibility of the Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like once again to point out that Commissioner Reding has announced a dramatic change in the information strategy of the EU and has thus made it clear that there are deficiencies, that fresh efforts must be made and that we must make this issue a focus of our concerns.

I do hope that, as well as making speeches in the Chamber, honourable Members will get on to their own parliaments and governments to ensure that when we reach agreement on one of these associations agreements it can be ratified rapidly.

In this context, the Commission has performed its monitoring role and produced a raft of reports, and the communication we are discussing today is part of this undertaking.

Some are identical, tabled by different Members; and there is even a case of two identical amendments being tabled by the same Member.

Regulated in that, all too often, there is insufficient planning, airports are located in inconvenient places and airlines are prevented from expanding by the presence of military corridors or restrictions.

In the case in question, there are no technical difficulties to justify that exception, and the regulation has been substantially amended throughout its negotiation to give it more flexibility, in such a way that, in our opinion, all the difficulties raised by the different Member States can be resolved within the margins of flexibility which the regulation allows.

But I am at a loss as to why MEPs manoeuvre themselves time and again into predicaments where they either face the accusation of being of an anti-social disposition, or else risk becoming a laughing stock.

Mrs Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission appreciates the progress made and shares the inspectors' desire to see a steady drive towards an improved safety culture at all levels of management, and, of course, within my competences, or rather in this field, my non-competences, I shall keep a watching brief on what is happening at Sellafield.

I particularly appreciate the good collaboration with Parliament in this case.

The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.

I realise that my question will be more properly posed to the Agriculture Commissioner, but Mr Byrne is responsible for food safety, and clearly there is a risk to the safety of food in France if the findings of the Food and Veterinary Office are accepted.

As usual, it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach.


The right to family reunification is crucial to normal family life. What is more, this right has long existed in the form of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which all persons have the right to family life.





On the subject of agriculture, we cannot relinquish existing resources, which are considered to be vital for the basic subsistence of certain agricultural areas, but, on the other hand, we have foreign policy commitments, such as Kosovo and others, and there are therefore imbalances in our budget.

Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued.

It is important that we find a new way of doing it.
It has to be this way, as we have been through a tricky time, and there are permanent tensions and glaring contradictions.
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.

The greatest achievement was reaching agreement on a uniform Community-wide labelling scheme for beef.

Mr President, with tomorrow' s vote, Parliament will take an initial step towards defining a legislative framework intended to win back consumer confidence in the quality of foodstuffs on the market in the European Union. This goal can only be achieved through a wider strategy such as that outlined in the White Paper on food safety, and we too must make every effort to speed up its practical implementation.
Reference was also made to the overall approach defined in Barcelona (and not just, as the Commission thinks, the structural adjustment dimension), the intensification of regional cooperation, particularly South-South relations, the importance of decentralised cooperation (contrary to the wishes of the Commission which would apparently like to do away with it), the maintenance of support for micro-projects, i.e. for NGOs and civil associations and the need to finance initiatives for industrial cooperation, particular for SMEs.

There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force.

Another area where this framework decision impacts is that of encouraging European countries to adopt sanctions, or at least a system making environmental crime a punishable offence for legal persons.
Thankfully there is now an awareness among citizens of the importance of protecting the natural environment, and in my view the social and economic climate is conducive to achieving this objective.




That would be one way of resolving the problem in many spheres, for example, we should simply do more to encourage the public to get into this habit with their television sets.
The directive which is currently being prepared should, in my opinion, have two objectives.


Mr President, this is an important subject.





I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.
Yesterday, the President of the Council was in the Chamber from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. while the number of Members of Parliament present was not great - and, in actual fact, we prevented both the Council or the Commission from replying to extremely important questions posed by Members.
When, under the eEurope programme, the aim is in place to bring a computer cable into every home, that will increase democracy.



Article 157(3) is the legal basis proposed by the Commission, and Parliament is seeking to add another legal basis, the article on culture.

We were also able to see the shortcomings in the political arena, which were quite clear in the climate of great violence that marks relations between the government of Mrs Hasina Wajed of the Awani League and the opposition, particularly the Nationalist Party of Bangladesh, which does not participate on a regular basis in the work of the national parliament.








There are so-called rules of transmission between Parliament and the Council, which have prevented these questions from arriving today.

That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.
There are, however, different views on how to achieve greater safety.
Mr President, it seems that the long road to creating a single regulation on the legal protection of designs, drawings and models in the European Union is nearing its end.
I am referring here to Article 17.
Second: the accidental occurrence of contradictions in interventions by different countries on issues affecting the interests of the European Union.

The presence of these two distinguished persons indicates that the peace process is not purely a process taking place between governments.
I would like to congratulate the authors of the comprehensive report.

I was even somewhat surprised to hear Mrs Ghilardotti mention consumer safety.
We women are already familiar with this procedure.
This does, of course, contain a number of good observations. For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.
Our aim is a pro-active policy. We want to anticipate change, because the future, and especially the economic future, is being built now.
This is why I believe that a cut in the general tax burden, as proposed by my party in Belgium, is to be preferred to a specific tax burden on fuel.




The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax.
Mr President, as has been pointed out, the influence of the European Union in Latin America is important from an economic and commercial point of view, but also from a political point of view, and this is characterised by our encouraging a type of relationship which favours egalitarian treatment - cooperation and the promotion of democracy - and this is completely opposed and different to that which has for centuries originated from Big Brother, in the north of the continent.
Therefore, there is little chance of the Commission being able to secure successfully the adoption of measures by Member States, as requested in the report.
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.

We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.

We hope that the report and in-depth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming.

tim1, It shows mini previews of the workspaces


Therefore, in looking at the market-opening regulations, we have to look at methods of competition and encourage competition between the different parts and elements of the platforms.
Mr President, the MEDA programme is a crucial instrument for enabling us gradually to establish a genuine area of shared prosperity, as stated in the Barcelona Declaration.


We have congested airports to contend with and this is why, Commissioner, it is of great importance that you at long last make a proposal on the management of slot allocations for airports.
In the ruins of the Berlin Wall, however, traces of new divisions are appearing in Europe.
While we may not be able to devote to each report the time its importance would merit, we can safely say, when we discuss human rights elsewhere, in the rest of the world, that we have not omitted to carry out a serious analysis of shortcomings here in the European Union itself.

carlos: "aleatory"?

Finally, it must be made unequivocally clear once and for all that our Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions excludes not only the patentability of the human being, of parts of the human genetic make-up and of interference with the genome, but also forbids the cloning of human beings at all phases of their development.

Mr Andersson, you have asked me two separate questions.

I am very grateful to Parliament and the Council for making that prudential transfer possible before Christmas.

Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam.

We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.

We have already achieved some progress in the area with the IMPEL inspectors' exchange programme and the other work that IMPEL has done on inspections, monitoring frequency of inspections etc.

Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.


Mario Monti and I have established contacts with the footballing world.

Since then, things have largely returned to the normal routine.


What is unacceptable is that a state that maintains relations with the EU should be allowed to respond by attempting to undermine the dignity and honour of a fellow Member of this House.
The provisions of the financial regulation on this point do not need to be revised.









ChrisH: where? :)

It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection, for example, with tax issues and cyber crime.

According to a lady in the village, in the old days, mothers would contract leukaemia at the age of fifty.
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.


I am not averse to a federal structure for the European Union.


We certainly do not lag behind England, or Great Britain, in that area.

If insurance cannot be taken out to cover such circumstances, then the risk in granting a licence is too great.

That is at least based on a reference but then some mass media in Spain, whereas I cited Hegel as a quotation, have put in Nietzsche and this is no coincidence at all.


The existing plants which do not at present fulfil the requirements are also to be given a good few years in which to be adapted to the new requirements laid down here.
It is very basic and very essential and has to be treated differently from normal goods.
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.

As far as the entry into force of the regulation is concerned, we agree in principle with the Commission' s approach that compulsory labelling should be introduced in two stages, but we do not agreed with the timetable insofar as we think that the date of 1 January 2003 has been put far too far back.


Our diplomats send back clear reports on the Israeli settlement policy and also clear reports - as we told all the Palestinian leaders we met - of the violations performed by the National Palestinian Authority.
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.


Secondly, I should like to stress the urgent need to include effective protection for personal data held on computer within the scope of the charter.


What I mean is, right now, I can imagine farmers running along behind their cows - Daisy or Buttercup, maybe - and fussing over feeding them hay, fodder and products from their fields, whereas they may well not have had time to have their animal' s health checked.



I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.

We support the Commission so as to make this possible.

With regard to these people it is also necessary to apply certain measures so that they can rebuild their lives correctly, not only from an economic point of view, but also through psychological, legal, medical and social assistance.



I should like to finish by adding, as Mr Gallagher said, that we do not wish to see regionalisation become renationalisation nor do we wish for further social measures to be introduced into the common fisheries policy.
Incidentally, it also seems to me that the advisory office, which was mentioned earlier, would be surplus to requirements, and I do not intend to go into this matter any further at the present time since previous speakers have already taken care of it.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12 noon.

This contrast was highlighted once again during the debate on car tyres.

Moldova is still living proof of this.
Mr President, freedom of the media lies at the heart of democracy.



We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future!

I hope from the bottom of my heart that this legislation, which I believe Parliament has upgraded in terms of quality, will never have to take effect.
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.
The committee observes, therefore, that the Ombudsman ought to play an important part in implementing a future charter of citizens' rights.

I thought that part of the amendment was very valuable although there were other aspects of it which I could not support.


Today' s report from Luxembourg is good news but we would say, nonetheless, that Turkey must realise that respect for human rights and minority rights are prerequisite to any accession negotiations.
Our historic monument days are always very well attended.
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.


gimp 2.2 in hoary?


Events such as this will continue to recur unless and until we establish the "polluter pays" principle in the fullest sense of these words.
I am also particularly glad that Commissioner Nielson is present here today.


How far has the work progressed when it comes to the transport sector and lorry drivers?
Finally, strictly in terms of the actual budget, the proposal for a regulation puts a little more pressure on Category 4 of the financial perspective, for external measures, which is already under great strain on account of funding the reconstruction in the Western Balkans. If it were implemented this year, a supplementary and amending budget would be required.
Democrats in this country now need our support more than ever.
so don't worry about it
I should like to pay tribute to the Commission.

As you know, our basis is Article 13 and it is an article which limits our room for manoeuvre.
I hope that, beyond this vote, there will be enough of us to relaunch the initiative in time, in this spirit, and, this time, to hold out until the end.
That should suffice, but it is wise to add the provision on negligence as something which can be brought into play within the courts.

The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.

In the brief time that I have, I would like to concentrate on one specific point which the previous speaker has mentioned, as indeed have other speakers.

Nothing is so enduring as the accidental.


It offers the prospect of large profits, however, for the multinationals, who have been working behind the scenes for around fifteen years to achieve their ends, i.e. having the derogations granted, on the occasion of a number of countries' joining the Union, extended to become the general rule.
It conflicts with Article 190 of the Treaty which provides that the number of elected Members must ensure the appropriate representation of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community.
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.



jordi: hey
We know that the cost of the fats capable of replacing cocoa is much less.
We should no longer have to sit in the committee rooms looking at the students from the Permanent Representations, in possession of documents to which we ourselves have no access.
We can only deplore the far from constructive attitude of the rapporteur both within the parliamentary committee and with regard to the European Commission.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.


Mr Trakatellis, opinion is extremely divided as to how unsafe the reactors 3 and 4 actually are.
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.
Here is the latest example: I submitted a question in October, to which I have not received an answer to this day, namely when is the Council going to get round to implementing the salary increase promised to the Europol staff?
They possess a wealth of human and material resources, which are often the prerequisite for successful productions.
The response to the reform process is significant additional investment from Europe.
Allow me to conclude by saying that the reports that will be discussed after mine show that there are also violations of human rights within the EU.

I think that you have spoken on behalf of many.


What we must understand above all, however, is that, in the medium term, it is by producing a proactive immigration policy at European level, backed by clear criteria, which are shared by all Member States, that we will guarantee victory in this battle.

It is ruled by a dictator who deems his own power and privileges more important than the lack of stability of his country and the suffering of his own people.

On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region' s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb.
For example, one in four Zimbabweans will die from HIV/Aids, including one in three in the capital, Harare.


Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.



In my opinion, two goals need to be brought into focus, in addition to the recommendations which are currently in the report.
Let us do everything possible so that 2001 might truly be the year in which we do achieve it.

B5-0264/2000 by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Fava on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?


Next, having heard what most of the speakers said on the issue of Poland, I am left in no doubt as to many of the things said in corridors and about the pressure of which I was informed, which was brought to bear on the representatives of Poland, a free State.

sabdfl: don't worry, you'll get a bill for it ;-)  ;-)
We had one British petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the French authorities, presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects.
hi pitti 
By means of this Charter we intend to bind the European institutions to a bill of fundamental rights and to bind the Member States to those same rights in their transposition and application of Community law.
Clearly, they can contribute to this and we must give them the means to do so.
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.
tha_gamemaster, lemme find the right page

Lastly, I wish to sound a warning about point 9 of this report, because measures for protecting new mothers, such as very long maternity leave, may have unwanted effects, as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women, and they may consequently prefer to take on men.
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.
One of these is the inadequate level of protection for data collated and processed in the institutions.

maybe its these cheap cd's i have

This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.
We must produce a lot of food to feed people and that must be properly addressed as well.

A second tranche will be allocated to aid in support of the reform process initiated by the Russian authorities recently in order to establish a genuine rule of law, which will bring the TACIS appropriations allocated to Russia in 2000 to EUR 92 million at the most.

The means and resources donated by the European Community would not be used for healthy growth, but would serve to further strengthen the canker of underground organisations.
It is a contradiction to preach the reconstruction of Central America taking account of respect for the environment, according to a model of sustainable development, while we continue to maintain the same economic relations with those countries.



This means that Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom should remain outside the campaign while the krona and the pound are still the currencies of those countries.




They are at the sharp end; they know what they are talking about.
We can see the feverish way in which the potential for investors has snowballed and the phenomenon of 'start-ups' has developed, but we are also aware of the staff turnover that typifies call centres due to the dreadful working conditions that reign in these new temples of Taylorism, which employ hundreds of thousands of people.

merry x-mas all ubuntu-users and developers
In my view, the real nature of the problem, illustrated and interpreted against the backdrop of the Treaties establishing the European Union themselves, from the Treaty of Rome onwards, and against history and European law, has been wiped from all your minds, except for the odd refrain, muttered like a prayer, of human rights and so on and so forth.
They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution.

Mario Monti's departments are ready to examine these, within the shortest possible time, with the aid of my departments and those of Anna Diamantopoulou.

In the course of 13 project modifications, environmental impact assessment has been simply disregarded.

This severely restricts the ability of families with dialysis-dependent members to travel.

Finally, how does this all fit into the broader modernisation effort?
calamari, did you mod hdparm?
When you think what that means in terms of congestion and environmental impact, then clearly that is a nightmare.

Mr President, I voted for the Swoboda report as well.
Madam President, on behalf of the 31 delegates, there is actually little I could add to your words. I would, however, like to underline how we have been moved not only by what you said a moment ago and the silence that was observed, but also by the prompt assistance across the borders to relieve the distress following this disaster.

This brings me to the wider issue of the United Nations.
Mr President, assuming a driving role in the European Union means implementing a series of guidelines which have thus far existed more on paper than as part of practical action.

Together with the Council' s determination to arrive quickly at a common position, the report has helped with the efficient reading of the Commission' s proposal.
Secondly, Mrs Lalumière spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly.

Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Klamt, who was the original rapporteur designated by the committee which I have the honour to chair to look at this issue.

The report contains excessive statements which are reminiscent of a certain type of terrorist propaganda which I do not feel would advance our awareness-raising operation, also because whenever we go to extremes in these sectors and these fields we obtain the opposite effects to those desired.
To conclude, may I say, on behalf of the Commission, that, unfortunately, we are repeatedly having to instigate infringement proceedings against Member States in matters of environmental law, and there is a large number of infringement proceedings pending in this self-same sector.

In this sense, and because the debate is public and European public opinion is horrified by what it has heard, I think that we all have an obligation, if we are to avoid being accused of complicity, to ask the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union who, until recently was the Secretary-General of ÍÁÔÏ and who is under investigation by the International Tribunal in the Hague for crimes against humanity, according to a statement by the public prosecutor in the Republica and other newspapers, to explain why, as Secretary-General of ÍÁÔÏ, he gave the go-ahead for a mini nuclear war in the Balkans.

I would like to thank Mrs Lucas for the efforts made to achieve flexibility, as it is clear from her amendments that this is not exactly what she would like as a report, but she is looking for a compromise that makes parliamentary approval possible.
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.
Mr President, I voted against this report because I judge a good bottle of wine by its contents, not its label.
A certain amount of amendment will be necessary prior to the second reading, but the PPE-DE Group is prepared to accept the report overall.


This situation has been made even worse by the reserve of appropriations that the Commission is building up for itself, which, when taken in conjunction with specific actions, in fact leaves the organisations with only EUR 3 million, which is obviously a very limited amount.


We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions.
I can report to you that this will be one of the main topics of a ministerial conference organised by the Portuguese presidency in Lisbon in early April.
What are we trying to do there?
Further dismantling of the social rights of workers, starting with the right to social security, is on the agenda of the Feira Summit.
We could even forgive it all that, because conservatism and perhaps even a little dogmatism go with the job of central banking.
FIFA has certainly been very slow to act and should be criticised for that, but the Commissioner must also be prepared to listen to the small clubs, the players' organisations, and spectators.
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.

Taking the latter point first, I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers' needs.


With regard to your question on the reopening of the railway line between Oloron and Canfranc, we must study the land-based and sea-based alternatives which may help to alleviate the situation of traffic congestion at the two eastern and western extremes of the Pyrenees.
Before discussing the individual amendments, I want to touch upon three key issues, namely best available technology, the frequency with which the environmental statement is to be validated and the link between participation in EMAS and compliance with the requirements of compulsory environmental legislation.

So the proposed review process becomes essential.


However, we also support the initiative relating to the summit' s main objective, which has already been mentioned. We do so because for the first time, it is not only putting the issue of employment and social issues at the centre of the European debate but is once again suggesting that "achieving the objective of full employment" is in the realm of the possible.
In our opinion, the aim of the Lisbon Council should in fact be to iron out these inflexibilities, to promote flexibility and the ability to adjust, and to exchange positive national experiences with a view to fostering the creativity that can only flourish when peoples are given freedom of choice.

Of course, there are also other problems involving minorities.

At some contact points, the willingness to make regular exchanges also left much to be desired.
linux_mafia, ok :(


The Fund will not, in this form, cause any country to switch to a policy of greater openness towards the immigration of refugees.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his excellent report and on his suggestions for rationalising the Commission' s proposals.
Mr President, I would just like to respond, very briefly, to the most important arguments raised.

The Council is at present examining the possibilities open to the Union for making a contribution in the humanitarian and cultural sphere within the framework of existing resolutions concerning Iraq from the UN Security Council.
Is the Council acting upon this?

We hope that the rationale behind these two commitments will lead to a reduction in the amount of ship-generated waste deposited illegally in the sea, thus strengthening the marine environment and also improving competition between ports.

I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens' information service.
A fortnight ago, I visited Kosovo with 12 colleagues, and that was when Kosovo Albanians gave us these 75 000 signatures.

Mr President, the regulation we are now to be discussing concerns the prior conditions for ensuring that, under the European Union's aid policy, better account is taken of the physical environment and of basic natural resources in conjunction with various development projects.

What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.

Framing this right and creating optimum conditions for it should be a key priority for this Parliament!
Mr President, the Nice Summit was characterised by weak decisions. However, it will not impede progress towards an ever stronger European Union.


I should also like to ask two questions of the Council and the Commission, the first on regional cooperation between the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and the second on the role of the European Parliament in the Barcelona Process.
The European Union cannot make a special case of Turkey which must be treated exactly the same as any other candidate country.
Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work! That is why a broad majority of the committee - not a large majority; the representatives of the minority view will be speaking shortly - said, as Parliament as a whole did in the first reading, without any dispute, that the 'no-special-fee' system was the best system because it, as it were, offers ships a financial incentive not to dump their muck into the water when they are at sea but to dispose of it in proper port reception facilities.
guru: sudo is your friend

I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.


On the one side, there are the 15 states of the Union and, on the other, Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian territories.
Such measures must already form a part of the operational situation.




I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.
Although I say this, in no way does this diminish the Commission' s responsibility, which is a great one.

Clearly the lawlessness and violence has undermined that constitution but we must look more deeply at the causes of the conflict.


The European Parliament takes this aspect of the future of young people very seriously, which is why we keep pressing to have equivalent qualifications recognised in all Member States.
I do not know whether you have seen an almond tree in February, well it is truly a thing of beauty!
Yet this would be even more important because not only are industrial secrets being monitored, but also the private and political activities of people in the EU.

According to the trade unions in the ETUC, 300 000 jobs have already been lost and a further 200 000 are threatened.

We can therefore welcome its adoption.


ok
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.
The projects, which are now to be financed in concrete terms under this budget line, encompass cooperation projects, business-related training programmes and programmes for promoting trade relations.
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.
The fact remains, however, that at this stage they are no more than proposals and the Commission cannot contravene the regulations in force under the Treaty establishing the Communities, nor can it anticipate the decisions which the Member States will take at the Intergovernmental Conference.



Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.


- The British Labour members have a strong commitment to the producers in the Caribbean and wish to see an early settlement of the dispute within the WTO.

It is precisely because the real world is thus that we should be more careful and stricter when it comes to ensuring that horizontal cooperation agreements are treated and controlled in the same manner as mergers and vertical restraints.

There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.
sivang: basically you can vote and such but not upload packages

A large part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites.
As for the third, its integration is the most necessary and urgent. The fact that tobacco is not at the moment subsidised per hectare but by quantity produced in no way affects the possibility of this being immediately integrated into the system and even less so the advantages which this offers.
In order to grant the right of asylum, the States require proof of persecution.
In spite of the foregoing, being an optimist, I hope that in future this Council Presidency, like others before it, will take cognisance of its neutral position, and that at the end of the day, normality will also return to the group.

The issue is more complex than that, for although, Mrs Schroedter, it may be precisely these young people that grab the headlines, they do live with their parents and exist within a social sphere.

Possibly we could have a vote on it now.

Admittedly, candidate countries must undertake not to counterfeit or make pirate copies of our services (only, perhaps, of our values) but we should also consider the countries with whom we sign customs agreements.

This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.

The result was that the Commission made a new proposal to us which was very similar to its first proposal, to which we again gave an essentially positive assessment in Parliament, and which then, because of the change of legal base - Maastricht gave way to Amsterdam - had to be recast in a new proposal, which is now on the table here and which we must once again debate.
But the real bottom line for Liberals is whether the Member States believe in and respect the notion of European citizenship, not only allowing the citizens of a Member State and their families to move around but also conferring such rights, to the greatest extent possible, on legally resident third-country nationals and their families - which unfortunately were not covered by the Commission report.


Whatever its content they are happy to call this product chocolate.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave its unanimous opinion on this range of questions.

(ES) Mr President, in 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) resulting in 20,000 victims and losses of more than EUR 5 billion (10% of the GDP of those countries which are already burdened by eternal foreign debt).
In the accession negotiations, it must be made clear to candidate countries that the issue is extremely important to us and is, of course, extremely important to relations with third countries, since the development of international trade must be based on the recognition of the protection of intellectual and industrial property.

This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it.
macewan: install of vs. on?
Interestingly, this is a term which Mr Chirac used in his response to the questions.

I represent the West Midlands which has some of the best beef in the world - Herefordshire beef and Shropshire beef.

Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?
At the same time, I would like to praise the Ombudsman for a model annual report which is easy-to-read and, at the same time, comprehensive.
I believe that the problem relating to the trafficking in diamonds, which has cost, and is costing, many lives, deserves much more decisive and firm attention from the Council.

Who was it that said that, for European citizens, I quote, "unemployment wrecks lives and societies for entire generations and, even though it is starting to fall, unemployment remains the main concern" ?
There should be no question of European money being used to pay for the spreading of racist views.

In the 4-5 years since electricity was privatised, prices have increased substantially, jobs have been lost and there is no longer a national, long-term electricity development programme.






Secondly, this decentralisation must also take place at company and industry level and not be limited to the headquarters of managerial or union organisations.
As some experts have said, on religious issues there are no half measures, but, if we are talking about the religions of the Book, which preach the love of God and our fellow man, it must be possible to find a solution between people.
and that is that.. so feel free to interject with how to do it via the GUI
He is blaming us for playing a party-political game. Well, Mr Kuhne, I can assure you that this is not the case.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sörensen for her report, which contains many proposals, and for the emphasis placed on the fact that trafficking in women and children is a violation of human rights.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our central concern must be to establish equal opportunities between men and women.


The Structural Funds actually went into public sector pay and social welfare, and it is very questionable as to whether they did a good or a bad turn to the Irish economy in those years, because they contributed to inflation and increased wage demands.
This was unacceptable, given that public health had been enshrined in the new Title XIII of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Before we begin I would like to advise you that, since this is a night sitting and we have a lot of work to get through, I am going to be very strict in applying time limits.

Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.
It is, therefore, also important to make it clear that the subsidy arrangements ensure that consumers obtain food at prices which, as a result of the subsidy, are lower than they would be without the subsidy.
(The sitting was suspended at 4.10 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m., pending the beginning of the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council)

Unfortunately, the debate so far has centred on cabin baggage and flight time limitations for flight crew.


When our citizens see what is happening, for example on the climate issue, and that we cannot get together and produce some kind of joint response, that is naturally something which will undermine confidence in our institutions.



Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.

Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being.
We thought the fight was over, but no, we were in for more with the new explanatory statement.
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.
This is particularly true in the case of Italy.

What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.
Up in the gallery, listening to you and me, are visitors.
Marble2, hmm.. do you have the sound server enabled?
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.
In the same way, we criticise something which is a reality: the United Kingdom, faced with considerable social pressures in the country, has decided to transfer its base for nuclear submarine operations and repairs to Algeciras Bay, without respecting its own standards, which do not allow it to have this type of base in highly populated areas.

After this, the amount, type and form of support will surely be for Parliament and the Council to decide.
The second concerns, for example, the work programme for environmental strategy...
As Guinea is a country with an annual available production of 250 000 tonnes of fish, and since its small-scale fishing fleet only has the capacity to catch 50 000 tonnes, this is clearly an agreement of mutual convenience, which avoids any conflict of interest and which also enables Guinea to obtain exceptional financing to develop its fisheries sector.
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population? What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?

Someone asked the question as to how mechanically recovered meat is going to be dealt with.
The framework decision would prevent this sort of crime from being profitable.
Pyramids and hierarchies are not really of much use here, because we know that talent bubbles up from below and from all those regions and all those milieus where talent breeds, both male and female, although female talent - and this has been pointed out many times before here - can only ascend to the very pinnacle of academia very slowly.
We must protest most strongly against such a move, which could not be justified on the grounds of cost and effectiveness.


However most Member States will ratify the Convention during this year, including some already this summer such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.
Let us not forget that in the exercise we are currently involved in, in these negotiations, it is a matter of knowing how the European Union will operate with 18, 20, 25, 27 or even 28 Member States, in order to ensure that each of these states, the ones who are already members and the ones about to join us, may get the most out of the single market, a market whose treaties have made a driving force of the economic and social development of Europe.

The rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously; as an islander I feel obliged to extend her my special thanks.


If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world, we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem.
If we simply give money as a direct form of budget aid to the organisation, then the Commission will completely lose track of things and no longer have any control.
The debate has been really illuminating and has shown the great interest and also the expertise of Parliament on this issue.
- (DE) The Paciotti report on the 'safe harbour' agreement has my approval, although it will not solve the problems attending transatlantic data protection for the following reasons:
In research, however, objectives for activities should not be defined at too detailed a level.
The mobilisation of private capital is perhaps our key demand along with the pilot project relating to the European Investment Bank.

Secondly, Madam President, I would like to remind Mrs Palacio, in particular, although I am sure that she is familiar with them, of the provisions of Rule 7(4)(2).

When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"
The modernisation of the European social model and its increased effectiveness are as important for our competitiveness as the corresponding modernisation of the economy.
So when the honourable Members reject the amendment tabled by William Abitbol, simply asking that this integrationist objective be clearly stated in the Commission' s communication programmes, they are contributing to a propaganda operation which their voters will most certainly punish them for.
We will be following the situation in Peru with the greatest vigilance and are prepared to rethink our relations with Peru against this background.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been disturbed to see renewed acts of violence in the Basque Country. The Commission agrees with the repeated and forceful statements that have been made condemning these loathesome acts of terrorism committed in the territory of the Member States of the European Union - in all Member States, but particularly in Spain.
We understand the difficulty of the situation in Indonesia, but it is essential to demand that the Indonesian Government should exercise its authority on its own territory.

There is also a tax argument which plays a big part in Mrs Glase' s thinking.


My second question is this: are you going to radically adapt the current French Council proposal with a view to achieving greater transparency?

The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.
I believe this kind of wording will attract the broadest consensus here, and therefore enable us to make progress, for what matters most is that the directives are now put forward to us.

The benefits of a common, legal and budgetary framework to support our relationships with the industrialised countries are clear.


Mr President, before taking part in this debate, I reread a very interesting document, the text of a complaint lodged with the Court of Justice in 1996 by the French farmers' association Syndicat agricole français de la coordination rurale and by Philippe de Villiers against the Commission, which the plaintiffs accused of mismanaging the BSE crisis, putting the principle of the free movement of goods before public health and failing to apply the precautionary principle.

Unbridled globalisation calls for ever-increasing political regulation, coordination, harmonisation and supranational bodies, on a scale and to a standard which is commensurate with organised crime.

The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.
As the Union has stated through its Presidency, most recently in July last year, in principle we are in favour of one China, but we also want the tension which breaks out from time to time between Taiwan and the People' s Republic of China to be resolved peaceably within a constructive dialogue.



The only way to achieve a sustainable increase in the employment rate is to give companies the entrepreneurial room for manoeuvre which they need in the form of framework conditions.





The funds appropriated are not sufficient and the staffing is certainly inadequate.
Nonetheless, in a region torn apart by a rearguard conflict, this crisis leaves a particularly bitter taste, because every penny paid to buy a gun, to buy ammunition, aggravates an already precarious economic, social and nutritional situation.
There are no grounds for suspending regulations.
So our opinion stresses two key points which the rapporteurs, moreover, seem to share.
it is desirable to provide for the possibility of continued voluntary or optional insurance to preserve and improve pension rights and guarantee a right to payment of the capital under certain conditions.

The trouble with the Council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at Berlin.
We therefore need to muster all our resources and bring all our strategies into play, so that we are appropriately equipped in our fight against organised crime.
I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances - particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom - for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him.
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is a good thing, but I would like to remind you that there is an action plan that has been implemented, that of Iraq, on which nobody has ever provided us with any information.

This is for the social and research fund, but again these objectives could be better addressed by a bank that would ask other banks to manage investments so that we have the highest return.
If we could make Pernille Frahm rapporteur for European cooperation, too, then I am sure that we could agree about that issue as well.
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?

But what the Transport Committee considered even more important was that this agreement points the way to a transport policy entirely in line with that of the EU: reducing the burden on the roads while supporting transport by rail.

It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.
We have to make sure that the schools can deliver them and I am quite sure that what is contained in this report is one of the ways that we can help raise the standards in schools.

Immigration policies which revolve around the consequences and which are not aimed at tackling the causes will do nothing more than exacerbate this terrible pattern of exploitation which is tantamount to slavery.


This means that we need a pressure instrument.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner, for your replies.

It' s not the quantity but the quality of sites that counts.


Animals are just the first link in the chain which leads ultimately to human beings.
In the German version alone, I have found more than twenty mistakes.
It is almost ironic that the new partnership deal, which considers democracy to be of paramount importance, was signed in Fiji at a time when that country was hit by a coup d' état.
But let us be clear - the key to the lifting of sanctions lies with the Iraqis.

This is unacceptable, certainly if Europe professes to be a Community of values.
We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year.
i guess it depends on what you need your computer for

It is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes, which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible.


This means we have to ask three questions of cohesion policy: why, for whom and how?


I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.

The conciliation on what is called the 'railway package' will have allowed us to lay the foundation stone.

Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.
With regard to the White Paper on the common transport policy, as well as the delivery of the revised Trans-European Networks, which I have promised you, I hope that the Commission will be able to definitively approve a text on that issue over the next few weeks.


This Convention was signed on 15 June 1990.
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.
grelli: you should not be whining :)
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.

We totally agree with the line of thinking adopted in this report.

If you have contamination of conventional farms or organic farms, there is basically no free option for the consumer.
We are, of course, fighting extremely sophisticated organised criminal networks which use advanced technology.
We further acknowledged that this right must be adapted to cater for the advent of the information society.



Madam President, I cannot forget how, when serving as Foreign Minister for my country in 1994, I used to study the findings and conclusions arrived at in this House very carefully. Through them, Foreign Ministers of Union countries were being urged to take action and not to allow such violent disregard for human rights in Bosnia Herzegovina to prevail.
Minced beef is as much, if not more, at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources.
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.



I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.
A fourth point, in my opinion, is the reorganisation of the fisheries policy which must be further developed.
We must therefore set up a proper information and explanatory campaign.
pitti: well, both is ideal
We need to find more effective ways of working together.




2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	anir	so bob2 what should i do?
At this hour in the day and stage in the debate, I think it preferable and far more useful to get straight to the point with what I have to say.
First, your rapporteur is calling, with the greatest respect, for a report, a Commission proposal, within the year, on the application of this system to meat products.


We therefore believe it is too soon to establish that all circumstances justify a screening and a broad scope.

We are all aware of the increasing scale and the frequent cross-border effects of this type of crime.

I mention this because a balance must be struck between developing countries and countries with a large fishing industry, but it is also necessary to strike a balance in the way funds are spent across the various fishing zones.
However, it was the Court of Auditors that carried out the audit, an institution that has no form of personal interest in the matter and it is no good playing down the mistakes.




It is important to remember that.

Fifthly, we must demand a change in Turkey's laws.
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.
Mr Gemelli spoke about what I think is a very important issue, namely the dialogue with Islamic society.




Due to this thorough preparation I am in a position today to agree in full or in part to almost three-quarters of your proposed amendments.
New negotiations have started in Geneva, in a fug that is not dispelled straightaway by Mr Lamy' s praiseworthy speeches to this Parliament, and the European Union, hot on the heels of the United States, is negotiating the future conditions for China' s accession.
I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive, as I pointed out a moment ago.
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.
Mr President, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen' s question is a very important one, but we do not have any information to the effect that the Commission is considering reducing state aids in this field.



I would really like to know what we can do from the European Union to try to ensure that the opposition groups - and there are 26 parties standing in the election - have some access to the media.



If this is what we finally decide to do, we think it may be very useful.
We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare.
And when these activities are conducted in the context of the profit motive and its obscure interests, then we must be especially attentive and constantly vigilant.


New methods and sources for acquiring knowledge and training have appeared.

On the other hand, although we do not disagree with splitting the maximum guaranteed area into two, we feel it is necessary to adjust the historical reference period in order to calculate each of the maximum guaranteed areas excluding the last three years, in order to reduce the damaging impact for Portugal on products designed for human consumption.
We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned.


I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.

we have a fully transparent gnome-panel in hoary! yippie
The recommendations are now clear in the amendments tabled by the MEPs and myself as rapporteur.

Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.
Mr President, I welcome the Lisbon conclusions.
With regard to the OISIN programme, and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year, projects were adopted for seminars, training, exchanges of officials, research and studies, and operational actions.
Incidentally, it is all very well for people to be critical - for stylistic reasons among others - of the fact that we have a whole host of detailed regulations.

It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27.
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.








In fact, it is another Chile written small.



However, two aspects which I think essential are missing.
Lastly, improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes.
We consider that the problem associated with the resignation of Mr Pelinka is important enough not to be tackled by a resolution that is emotional but does not actually say anything and is extremely watered-down.






Conversely, those who have something to lose wall themselves in and for their own security hire those who previously had professional roles in the army and the police.
Against the backdrop of the Israeli presidency elections to be held on 6 February, this verbal attack thwarted conclusively the plan for a meeting between the Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Arafat in Stockholm today.



In our opinion, the open method of coordination, which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon, should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment, which, we feel, cannot be ignored.

The Union' s strategic goal for the forthcoming decade must be to ensure economic growth and free enterprise, without violating the social question, with guidelines based on competitiveness, sustainable development and the creation of new jobs.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote.


I would ask Commissioner Verheugen specifically whether he is absolutely clear about the point mentioned in the resolution, that of bringing the investments in both oil and oil pipelines in Sudan to a halt for the time being.
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.

The real figure is more than three times that.
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?


If these groups are involved in the right way, eco-labelling will also develop very much more quickly.
Finally, I would like to point out that there has been talk of the collapse of the world of football.
In bringing forward that legislation, of course, it will be necessary to have detailed consultations with the other Commissioners, and in particular Commissioner Fischler, who has the responsibility for the CAP.

This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.
Lastly, I should like to say that although one might criticise certain aspects of the report, I have no hesitation in recommending that you adopt it, and I hope that the proposals it contains are given the reception that they deserve.
As an auxiliary language, it can provide one means, amongst others, of facilitating communication between all European citizens.

The first is that, thanks to the excellent proposal by our rapporteur Mr Bourlanges, we have indeed managed to provide 20 million for Montenegro, where we have agreed to urgent procedure.


There is, in my view, a difference between this conflict and the other conflicts in Indonesia and also some difference in the character of the response of the Indonesian Government.
gtkpod takes bloody ages to add directories to the list

We will only be able to reach a conclusion as to whether what is happening here is a positive step once the court cases are over.
It is a problem that emerged in the United Kingdom more than a decade ago and which, since then, has spread to the whole of continental Europe.

Another man who was about 70 years old said: "I suffered the same accident with the same results, and I was given EUR 1 000" .
Have the competences of the European Parliament increased substantially with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the consequent extension of the codecision procedure to further areas of policy, for example?

Our rapporteur also referred to this.
https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NewDevelopersAndMaintainers
However, the Swedish Parliament has instituted a number of changes to the legislation concerning monetary policy in order to facilitate Sweden joining the euro.
This concept, for some sort of European gendarmerie, has far-reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion.
This was the background to the Commission' s having an assessment made of those hormones which have been used.
With regard to the convention, I would add one more element, and that is that, in the drawing up of the Charter, the convention is turning out to be a more transparent, democratic and open formula than the classic procedure of the Intergovernmental Conferences.
In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters: coups d' états, violence, wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed countries. We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation.
I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal.
However, no non-member country has made use of this facility to date.
The unequivocal shortcomings in this area contrast with statements by Prime Minister Ecevit to the effect that Turkey may be ready to start accession negotiations in 2004.
President Napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference.


This is a perfectly sensible question because as President-in-Office of the European Union, you have worked and acted as the spokesperson for bilateral decisions between states.


That is why it has not yet been placed on our Bureau' s agenda.


This is also necessary in order to stem the disturbing migration flows of this last decade, which are a clear indication of the lack of a bilateral cooperation policy.

The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.

Is this directive going to affect them or is it not?
Mr President, I welcome this timely and useful debate, which was introduced characteristically and forcefully by my honourable friend, Mr Brok, in a thoughtful and useful speech.

My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.
Approximately half a million workers lost their jobs and one in four companies went bust because bigger and stronger companies got away with not paying them on time.
The next item is the report by Mr Radwan (A5-0169/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 1999 Annual Report of the European Central Bank [C5-0195/2000 - 2000/2118(COS)].


The European Parliament, however, is now caught in a dilemma. Should it issue a recommendation with regard to the Danish proposal or with regard to the Council of Ministers' amended proposal?
Furthermore, the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one.


There is still progress to be made in this area, but it must be noted that the evaluation culture seems to me to be more prevalent today in all the departments of the Commission and also among the programme managers.

So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us attempt once and for all to get a clear grasp of the state of affairs in Algeria.
However, whatever we do, we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened.
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.

They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may, at first sight, appear to be a bargain, is really a snare and delusion.

I am extremely grateful, like my colleagues, the other Scottish MEPs, to Commissioner Fischler for agreeing to meet us earlier this evening to discuss these dramatic emergency measures.
I did faithfully try in the Environment Committee to get the members to agree to a recommendation rather than a directive.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreements constitute a central point of this policy.
They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm.
As long as this is the case, the election date has to be postponed.



Mr President, this is a decisive moment for the future of the European Union. We are preparing for unprecedented enlargement and, at the same time, we are working on reform of the institutions in order to be able to best manage such a large political entity.
Finally, the report regrets that the advantage to businesses of treating the whole of the EU as a single market rather than as a collection of national markets is not always apparent to them. To remedy this lack of awareness which is additional to administrative obstacles and consumer behaviour, the report envisages 'mass information campaigns similar to those conducted in the case of the euro and incentives to encourage the private sector not to treat partners from other Member States unfavourably' .


Even if it feels unable to accept Parliament' s amendments because of the current international situation, I must say that the whole dossier has been handled very constructively and comprehensively in the various committees that have contributed to the Dary report and in the recent hearing held by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
These measures are a step in the right direction.

The majority of my group is of the view that the Fifteen ought to take radical environmental measures, effectively promoting rail transport while responding, in the present context, to this legitimate social expectation.
Sadly, it would appear that commercial interests are driving scientists to explore types of research which involve shortcuts and disregard all consideration for the protection of human life, which we consider to start at the moment of conception.
Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change, subject continually to examination, we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House.
It is good that the Council common position already incorporates some of the amendments approved by the European Parliament.



On Mozambique, for instance, it is very significant that the IMF, the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money.
One important aspect of this view is the whole-herd slaughter on a farm where disease has been discovered.

We will continue to work together, but I have a feeling that at the dawn of the 21st century, with this framework directive, Europe is entering a new age where the protection of water, that most fundamental resource, will become a priority in terms of policy and the behaviour of all those involved, whether they be farmers, industrialists or consumers.

We also of course have to consider Amendment No 26, in the name of some of our German colleagues, which rejects the common position.
Having said this, it is an ambitious and difficult project, because, as you have mentioned, it requires a change to the Treaty and to the constitutions of at least four or six Member States.





Mr President, I think it outrageous that the problem of accidents due to falls at work can give rise to some much opposition and cannot be sorted out more quickly.

It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.

Many positive changes have taken place since that time, not least since the new Commission took over.
Transparency implies that the Member States should define a clear public service mission, that financial transparency should be guaranteed and that, if public service operators carry on purely commercial activities, separate accounts should be kept.
It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child.



Mr President, ideally GMOs should not be released into the environment.

Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?



This right is currently only recognised by international legal instruments, specifically the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950.


In our opinion, the rapporteur' s arguments are convincing and we will give them our seal of approval.



Thank you, Minister, for your first response during your presidency.

The mandatory part of the scope applies to plans and programmes supporting authorisations for projects in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, waste management, water management, telecommunications, tourism, town and country planning or land use.
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.

It is a tidal wave that is going to grow year by year.
. (PT) This report contains amendments to the current regulations on the protection of Community forests against atmospheric pollution and forest fires.
We must have a majority of two thirds of the Member States, even if that means providing at the same time for a simple majority of Member States representing a majority of the total EU population.


Moreover, it is hardly in keeping with the spirit of the European Community to make it more difficult and considerably more expensive for people to meet each other in and between the various countries.
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.
The Fund has committed in excess of £400 million which has triggered an investment of £1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland.

This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.

Parliament firmly rejects abuses of fundamental freedoms throughout Europe, as the Haarder report emphasises.
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.







The tightening up of the visa requirements that has been carried out over the last few years has unavoidably led to more cases of people smuggling and to an increase in so-called illegal immigration to the Member States of the EU.
Moreover it is not just companies.

He will also have had a hand in it, but the origins of the fight against money laundering lie in the 1991 directive.




It is practically impossible for the European Union to constantly monitor all situations in all the countries with which we have a relationship within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.

Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation.
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.
Consideration has also been given to matters which may be included on the agenda of the IGC, on the Council presidency' s proposal.
As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.


We have received certain assurances from Mr Solana but we know, and our Italian colleagues in particular will remind us of this, that it will be difficult for those whose sons have died of leukaemia to accept that assurance unreservedly.
For example, we have been waiting since 1996 for the incorporation into Community legislation of the ban on landings from Honduras and Belize, or, for example, since 1998 for the control of the fishing capacity for albacore tuna in Community waters.

This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.

The fact that the Member States have been granted far-reaching powers to designate nature reserves, species to be protected, and certainly as far as the nitrates directive is concerned, the sensitive areas.


Mr President, the imbalance highlighted in the Piétrasanta report regarding the limited participation of decentralised operators and NGOs shows just how difficult it actually is for civil society to take hold of and take over this development instrument.
This means that, in six months, you will have to draw up a report on what you have achieved.



Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.



Sadly, today, we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about.
We are, unfortunately, the country without an EMU strategy.

Just imagine if a great many more Kosovars could have been helped in neighbouring Macedonia and Albania.
The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat.
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.

Food additives other than colours and sweeteners
They are moving from the entirely known to the not entirely known.

I would also like to appeal to the Member States, in the interests of the most vulnerable members of society, to implement as quickly and efficiently as possible the measures proposed by the rapporteur in his excellent report and by the Austrian initiative.

"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."
According to the translation, he did not vote and if he did not vote on a matter which is pertinent, then he behaved correctly.
In this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives: transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work.
The Commission shares many of the concerns expressed in Mr Paasilinna' s report on the current regulatory situation.

The prices of gas and electricity have sunk as the result of competition, Mrs Vachetta, including to consumers.


Grandiose ideas issued from on high and not adequately and rigorously tested at the sharp end will always fail, sometimes with damaging consequences for individuals and for society.

It is therefore imperative that we introduce harmonised requirements in order to maintain a high standard of safety which is not undermined by competition.
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.
not that i see
While it is true that the TACs must be determined chiefly on an objective scientific basis, dialogue with workers in the sector must certainly be established at institutional level and must be stepped up.
The directive proposed by the French Republic is based on the mutual recognition of deportation orders as soon as they are issued by a Member State of the European Union.
The current rules on old-age and surviving dependants' insurance conflict with the principle of equal treatment and equal status.
Now, at this time of revolution, a large number of issues dear to the European People' s Party must be reassessed.


Both of them have done a first-class job.

The industry endorses the legislator' s resolve to make transport, the movement of people and goods, which is a cornerstone of free movement, safer and less polluting.
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.
trukulo: checking...
The sub-text of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report is recognition of the deadlock between national governments, which fail to transpose Community law when it does not serve their interests, and companies, normally the principal beneficiaries of the single market, which have to be convinced of the benefits through information campaigns and 'incentives' .

Their action or lack of action has led to an understandable but justified consumer resistance with beef consumption at one point dropping by 27%.
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.
It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case.
We would be delighted to endorse family reunification measures, for this would be deeply humane and would also be key to an integration component, but what we have is something entirely different.
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.



It is important for the Freedom Party to clarify if it is still adhering to the principles described in its previous statements, and in particular the kinds of individuals through which those statements were made, because otherwise I cannot see any other solution except for the other Member States to continue to have the same kinds of reservations about their relations with the Austrian Government, with all the consequences that flow from that.
We need a single sky over a single market but at the same time we have to recognise that individual nation states have views about how these matters should be addressed, particularly insofar as they affect the livelihoods of the workforce and also the use of national airspace for military purposes.
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.
However, we believe that, in the future too, it should have the legal status of an intergovernmental tool.

The difficulties encountered by the Committee on the Environment in these three reports are indeed not limited to the three directives chosen but extend to all EC environmental directives.

International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there.
Mr President, I shall endeavour to explain myself clearly.

The conflict nevertheless continues and we still have considerable concerns.

We should accept increased responsibility for security on our own continent, but we should not take the place of NATO or create an embryonic form of permanent and independent European defence.
I would like to offer Mr Crowley certain assurances.
Mr President, I voted for the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications for nurses, pharmacists, doctors, midwives, veterinary surgeons, etc.
I have discussed with you in bilateral meetings on a number of occasions the question of the use of the comitology procedure and I note that request by the Commission is not being accepted in the amendments that have been put forward.
In our opinion, these are proposals that should promote rural development and improve food safety and product quality.

This has all too often been a very rushed process which has not allowed those of us involved to collaborate as we would have wished to find the best solutions to certain problems.
I am also pleased that specific vessels have been cited and that there is also a readiness to apply measures outside the territory of the EU.

We will revisit this issue at a later stage.
and I've tried a few

Finally, let me say that we in Parliament are not daunted or diverted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the adoption of legislation and not with its follow-up.
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.
There is a great deal at stake in piracy and counterfeiting, both for the people who are the victims of the illegal copying activities and of the counterfeit products, and also for the people who make money from them.

Mr President, my Group is highly delighted with the proposal to set up a European Refugee Fund and also with the way in which Mrs Frahm has tackled this problem in her role as rapporteur.

Firstly, my Committee is of the opinion that in the field of trade policy, the European Community' s authority and also, therefore, the European Commission' s negotiating mandate must be reinforced.
Before giving the floor to our rapporteur, Mrs Smet, we are going to hear from Mr Provan in his capacity as chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee.


It is therefore a sign of the profound institutional changes introduced by the Treaty and given top priority on the European political agenda by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council.

There should be a convergence programme, a kind of guideline for social security.
This would prevent the funding of projects that were not viable and the 'rag-bag' projects that are often seen in the Member States.
The real initiatives - highlighted by Parliament in all of its resolutions for years - are in some cases not even being discussed in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.




This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard. We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.


It is the question of textbooks, which I know has been of concern to a number of honourable Members of the House.
This, in combination with a modification to Article 17, which allows freedom of contract to choose ADR but respects existing consumer rights in the form of the unfair contract terms directive, presents a much more workable, legally certain package that will promote confidence.
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.
We believe that the Charter will have three principal effects: first, it will reinforce the constitutional character of the Treaty; secondly, it will be a point of reference for those, including this Parliament, that wish to drive European integration forward with a greater degree of democratic legitimacy; thirdly, a Charter that is stylish and forceful will strengthen the profile of the Union for its present and future citizens.

The next item is the report (A5-0125/2000) by Mrs Smet and Mrs Gröner, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform [2000/2020(INI)].
We took the necessary steps immediately, namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed.
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union.


That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.





These groups work to combat organised crime whose transnational dimension has been demonstrated on several occasions.
This has already been notified to the relevant linguistic services, and it has also been mentioned here in the voting list that was distributed to us, but I would like to remind everyone of the matter, so that it is taken into account when people vote.
I see that the French Council Presidency is extremely well disposed in this matter and so we should work on it over the next few days.


Permit me to close with a brief remark.
This means that the definitions we use should be specific rather than vague, and that the provisions we make should be enforceable, which is far from always being the case.
The committee of representatives of the Member States expressed a positive opinion, but the committee of Member States' guarantor authorities criticised the instruments.

That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.
The main element in this strategy of rapprochement will be the accession partnership which is currently being prepared and which will set out the short- and medium-term priorities which Turkey must meet, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, in the political, economic and Community acquis areas.

I also pass on my praise to the Dutch police for the way they conducted themselves, and to the people of Rotterdam. It was an excellent day out in Rotterdam.
The next item is the report (A5-0381/2000) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament resolution on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Priorities in EU Road Safety - Progress Report and Ranking of Actions.

In this instance too, then, let us hope that the European Parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future, before it is too late.



Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.


There can be no doubt about the cost-effectiveness of these agreements for the European Union, as demonstrated in the study commissioned by the Commission on their cost-benefit relationships.


In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.
Indeed we all hope that in the interests of the competitiveness of the European Union, this unending Community patent saga will now have a happy ending.



Mr President, unfortunately Mr Murphy cannot be here with us this evening and I therefore have the honour of representing him here today.
More specifically, the report points out that the Treaty of Amsterdam has introduced new human rights provisions in order to underpin EU action in this field, especially in the context of the CFSP.
I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now.



I am pleased to hear from the Portuguese Presidency that it intends to ensure that a Summit like this will take place again in the foreseeable future.
I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.

It was said in the discussion here that some Member States want to dismantle what we do collectively.
The caution displayed by the major political groups in the EP about investigating Echelon demonstrates that there is no great interest in focusing on secret service activities, as the European public would then be quite justified in asking what the national secret services and so-called 'defenders of the state' actually do.

Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation.

Even in Germany they should, in my opinion, consider dismissing historical fears that referenda might be generally dangerous.
On the contrary, we are grateful for the tremendous vigour with which you have been tackling the entire cultural agenda.
If we do not invest in it, the east of Austria will run the risk of economic exclusion in the future.


Furthermore, Parliament would lose the right to be informed and would have to rely completely on the goodwill of the Council, and this is, of course, completely inadmissible!
Secondly, project selection must be more democratic and must, to a greater extent, involve greater participation by civil society and NGOs, who continually expressed this desire, especially at the European Parliament round table held in Brussels on 29 June this year, entitled 'Towards a sustainable MEDA' .
However, we do recognise the delimitation problems and, if there is simply a reference to Article 280 of the Treaty, we are prepared to go along with the rapporteur.


hmmm, setting up apache is a lot harder than i expected



If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.
Our objective must be to work in close collaboration with the Commission in the interest of our fellow citizens and of the implementation of our policies, and to make the discharge report a proper assessment of the implementation of the European Union budget in both quantitative and qualitative terms.


In addition, it is important for them to exchange good models and experiences and that all those involved in the school are actually involved in the self-assessment process, including parents and students.

2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	bob2	vob indicates dvd
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we were more than happy to endorse this report, because we believe that environmental crime is still being underestimated, that its effects often go undetected and liability is sometimes difficult to establish.
How many were scrapped? How many were sunk and so on?
The whole purpose of co-development is to link up these countries' policies for development in order to exercise control over migration flows.
What I have, and what I believe I must share with you, are the moments when we have agreed years or months ago.


We too want to do likewise.



This was especially made clear in the 1996 white paper on the revitalisation of the Community' s railways.
Mr President, we can certainly support the thrust of the present resolution. After all, it is a clear departure from the Russian Federation' s unilateral decision to impose a visa obligation on Georgia.

Crane: I can'
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.


Our justice systems have always rightly placed the burden of proof on the accuser, not on the defendant.
In this area we must respond to public opinion.
This is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show, I really do have to say.
Mr President, I voted for this report, which is the first Alyssandrakis report on radio frequencies, which are nowadays used chiefly to advance mobile phone communications technology.



This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.
This will require the necessary time, not least because the implementation of the current proposal will have a ripple effect within existing legislation and systems within the different Member States. The change in the burden of proof is just one example of this.
I hope that tomorrow this House will support this position which, as I have said, is ultimately in the interest of the citizens of Europe.

The study of possible amendments to the Treaty in respect of the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions has also been started.

Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.



CheatersRealm: apt
We know this from some of the Member States.


What we are not sure about is whether this system has been redirected, not at purely military and defence objectives, but at commercial, industrial and technological targets. We fear and suspect this, however.
I now give the floor to Mr Barnier, on behalf of the European Commission, for another brief intervention.

I should merely like to use the force of my conviction together with you, certainly, and if possible also with the negotiators and Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok, to say to the States which are reluctant and more sensitive than others on this subject, 'Please pay careful attention before rejecting the application of qualified majority voting to proposals which the Commission has made in a reasonable manner.'
There are some Members in this House who will take advantage of this issue to demand that the principle of subsidiarity be strengthened, leaving Member States to manage road safety decisions as they wish.
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.
In the specific case of Mr Birdal, I was able to meet him in Turkey in January of this year and I told him during this meeting of the EU' s solidarity with his situation. It is clear in this respect that the EU has already indicated its concern to the Turkish authorities, through the appropriate channels, about his status and in particular his return to prison.




On Christmas Eve, a large number of coordinated bomb attacks against churches - including the cathedral in the capital, Jakarta - took place at a variety of locations in the Indonesian archipelago.
except in ubuntu and indeed other debian distributions you have a nice program called apt-get
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.


In this respect, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty is an example and especially an objective which must be pursued.


The matter of raising conciliation will be after the vote tomorrow.
In all areas covered by the Stability Pact, and therefore also in the economic and trade areas, reciprocal commitments between donors and recipients remain the key to the Stability Pact' s success.
We have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils.

In conclusion, we should recall that the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises the social significance of sport, but the European Union has no powers under the Treaty to take action on sport.
Nevertheless, to effectively combat child pornography, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly, as stated in Amendment No 20 from Gerhard Schmid.

So just stop, or leave. This isnt #defendlinux.


There were 5,318 cases of suspicion of irregularity or fraud investigated by UCLAF in 1998, in cooperation with the Member States, and around 20% of these cases were classed as fraud following the investigation.
Support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive.

Mr Katiforis' s explanatory statement is clearly better than the main body of his report which contains no hint of the criticisms that were set out on the Commission' s recommendation.




In order to function, the market needs rules.
Mr President, allow me to start, in this highly topical debate, by supporting what Mr Sylla said yesterday before the order of business, i.e. that we must begin by combating manifestations of racism here in this House and that we must stamp out the racist language to which the far right wing of Parliament frequently resorts.


I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.
Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support.

I must say to those people who said that employment in the sector would be reduced, that this has not been the case and that neither has the quality of work deteriorated in any way whatsoever. On the contrary, more jobs and wealth are being created.
I also agree with Mrs Jackson and her statement regarding the nitrates directive: "that was flawed from the beginning".
I would in any case like to stress that, in voting for the motion, I would also like to express the desire for a programme soon to be established in Europe, not just for the movement of young students between universities but also for the movement of elderly people who study at the university of the third age, who would welcome the opportunity to take part in exchanges with their sexagenarian, septuagenarian and octogenarian or even older peers from other States of the European Union.

Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing, of airline alliances, and in some instances even takeovers.


These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.
Pozac: thanks ;)


Being modest as to in our abilities will enhance the quality of the European Union' s external relations.
If the Council intends to finance actions in the Balkans at the expense of current external or agricultural policies, it would not only be showing a lack of political vision but it would also be failing in the commitments it has signed up to.
The point that the honourable Member raised expresses a legitimate and understandable concern.


These are the groups that are killing peasant farmers, the coca growers, and driving out the people living in areas valued highly by the oil companies.


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.
It is something which is not tangible in our day-to-day life, and there is still no so-called 'euroreflex' on the part of the population.
We do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress.
And I would once more like to address a question to the Commission, which is how adequate resources - staffing resources, for example - can be guaranteed so that this northern dimension policy also receives the go-ahead for an extension from the Commission.

Mr President, I should like above all to thank the rapporteur for this report.
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.
Finally, I wish to say that I believe this report is important because anything that helps the countries to the south of us, in turn, helps us.


I turn to the question at hand.





It is this very issue, an absolutely crucial one, that the consultation paper on the reform of the disciplinary procedure put forward by Vice-President Kinnock on 29 November, ignores, and it postpones a response until a later date.


The European Union's financial procedures, including the financial regulation are, to put it mildly, not NGO-friendly, which begs the question: should we stop funding NGOs or should we change our procedures?

Greece is being judged, just as the first countries in EMU were judged, and this judgement accords Greece the position which it deserves, the position which it could have taken up back then, when it could have become a member of EMU along with everyone else, but which it failed to take up because of the weakness of its government.
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, globalisation is a growing phenomenon which will entail innovations and will bring substantial change to all sectors of the economy.

Secondly, should the conditions be met for their repatriation - and we are pushing everybody concerned and some who do not think they should be concerned to make this happen - then the funds allocated by ECHO to the Tanzania programme will follow the refugees back home.

Similarly, however, I should also like to say that this remit will of course grow in conjunction with powers at European level.

Mr President, I note with some surprise that I am bringing up the rear, despite having been the first to request the floor in writing.

We will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise.
The request was made at the time of the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Amsterdam.

The religion of antiracism has its dogmas, its priests, its inquisitors and its witch-hunts.
The Commission will be setting up a website with this goal in mind, thus enabling interactive exchange with all parties, with the intention of taking these remarks on board when this directive is up for review in three years' time.
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	brute method to check, i know, but...
Is that perhaps why the conclusions on institutional matters were so brief?
Let us hope that it will improve.
It is evident what is going on if I tell you that one of these allegedly unqualified professors is now a professor at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Berlin.

The second shift in emphasis involves the failure to make it clear that the explanatory statement is distinct from the report.


However, if we are to succeed in this, our Member States must join forces and participate in this exercise.
On the contrary, it is preparing working people, and this indeed at a fast rate, to live in a situation of complete and permanent insecurity.
You do not buy an umbrella once it has begun to rain. Instead, you buy an umbrella when the sun is shining so that you are prepared for when the rain comes.





I am extremely pleased that I am now a Member of the European Parliament and can take specific action and that in this resolution all Groups are saying that the EU development cooperation budget should be doubled.

However, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done.
However, they are going to change simply for market reasons, even if OPEC does nothing. Furthermore, OPEC is prepared to act and I hope that it does so and does so well.
The rapporteur touched on some of them, and I would like to explore them again.
I am therefore in favour of an increase in the number of air traffic control centres as, not the unification of the whole control system, but the unification of the legal system and also technological unification takes place, as this report, and the research behind the report, have highlighted the absence of European will...
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators.
As far as the shutdown dates for blocks 3and 4 are concerned, it says in the text that this will be decided on in 2002.

A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.

The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report.


bob2: brad is on holidays
The Commission and Commissioner Vitorino have done some sterling work here, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to take the opportunity to thank them for it.
In actual fact, we have a budget for the development fund and, in broader terms, the development sphere, where clear goals are lacking and where staffing levels are inadequate within the critical spheres, which need to be worked on. All of this sets the scene for enormous backlogs and for a control culture dominated by self-interest and fear, rather than actual results and a duty to achieve results and take action.
What should one make out of such a schizophrenic picture, where, on one hand politically-motivated violence and intimidation cost more than 30 people their lives, with many more being threatened, persecuted, injured, raped and tortured, and, on the other, where the voters turned out nevertheless in record numbers, giving the opposition party almost half of the votes?
The Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, apologised as he will be unable to attend.

She was not allowed to meet the Russian President and was treated in a most humiliating way.
The report which I am presenting to Parliament aims to analyse one of the many aspects involved in this legislative task: the creation of a single secretariat for the three supervisory bodies for the protection of data from Europol, Schengen and customs information, within the framework of the third pillar and in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters enshrined in Chapter VI of the Treaty.
I hope that the French State, the city of Strasbourg and the European Parliament will be able to take steps to put such small matters right in so expensive a building.
Subject: Commission participation in the Council's military committee Does the Commission agree that its participation in meetings of the Council and all its bodies is an established part of the acquis communautaire and an essential element of the institutional equilibrium of the European Union?


I would therefore call for the broadest support possible.
It is, however, somewhat confusing if the President of the European Parliament expresses regret regarding one of Parliament' s democratic decisions and if she does so on Parliament' s official letter-headed paper, with a reference to the services of Parliament.
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.
Mr President, the framework decision put forward by the Council merely reproduces the Council of Europe Convention of 1998 on the prevention of environmental crime, a Convention which has not yet been ratified by any of the Member States of the Council of Europe.

I should also like to point out in this connection that, rather than planting more trees, we need to clear the jungle of paragraphs and exemptions.
We must come up with a rural policy geared towards regional needs and fairness between farmers if we are to preserve Europe's cultural heritage and the environment.
The other point I want to make is that 95% of fatal traffic accidents actually take place on the roads.
The Commission is also pursuing action in the social and educational field with a view to improving the situation of children.

In my opinion, this amounts to collusion, which makes Sudan just as guilty.
Clearly, the new Commission cannot be held directly responsible for the cases I have referred to, even if not all the members of the Commission are new.



More attention must also be paid to making it easier for companies to globalise, so that SMEs may take full advantage of the benefits brought by the internal market.
Following the adoption, on 10 April this year, of the regulation regarding the implementation of measures intended to intensify the EU-Turkey customs union, on 13 June this year the Council adopted its common position on the proposal for a financial regulation on the implementation of actions to promote Turkey' s economic and social development.
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.
(Parliament approved the common position (as amended))

I should like to stress at this point, that in my view, we will in fact only eradicate the disease effectively if we destroy the whole herd, regardless of how much this would cost both in economic and sentimental terms.

Mr President, I feel that we should not be too alarmist in these matters, and that, with regard to genetically modified organisms, we should not hold back scientific progress with an excessive amount of regulations.
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.




Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake.


The summit is not an international financial organisation. The problem of reducing or cancelling debt could not be solved at the summit.


I supported the amendments tabled by the Socialist members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.

I would like to mention one final point.
Unfortunately, our Group was unable, for a number of fundamental reasons, to vote in favour of the Ludford report on countering racism and xenophobia in the European Union.

B5-0645/2000, by Mr Sakellariou and Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Tibet

Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that, in an age when agricultural installations are monitored by satellite, it is so difficult to monitor a ship discharging waste at sea.


It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.

Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.
For example, high speed trains, and, in some cases, short sea crossings offer a more environment-friendly alternative to short flights.

The first is that the Commission recommends that my country, France, which is struggling under the weight of tax and social security contributions, should not take advantage of this growth to reduce taxes. The reason given for this is to avoid stimulating with the budget a level of economic activity which is already vigorous.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0100/2000) by Mrs Gröner, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Community action programme for youth [C5-0116/2000 - 1998/0197(COD)]

They are targeted at the most innocent civilians, at the innocent people in societies, especially children, the most vulnerable.


We must see an end to this method.


He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.
man my fingers must be retarded
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.
Only clear and decisive action by the international community as a whole can put an end to it: the arms embargo; the control of diamond trafficking; the deployment of a rapid intervention force, under the mandate of the United Nations; and the prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, the savage attacks against civilians, against international peace and security as well as against the United Nations forces.
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.




It also fascinates me because it demonstrates that parliaments, national parliaments that is, are not getting things moving quickly enough.
We must be seen to have free and fair elections and to demonstrate that they have been fair and free.

As all those present are well aware, this is not easy - we have a tremendous amount of work to do in this respect ourselves - but we can raise the issue that the role of women needs to be reassessed when it comes to questions of war and peace, for example.
In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships, I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance.
At the same time, the proposal to remove the aforementioned organs and tissues is a recipe for disaster for sheep- and goatmeat, which will be impossible to market; in other words, this measure will indirectly oust sheep and goat meat from the market, demand will be met by other types of meat from larger animals and traditional recipes using offal such as intestines and spleen will be banned.

Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.

Insensitivity to these phenomena would create new barriers between us.
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.
The debate with the Council will not be easy, just as the debate with Parliament has not been easy.



It is high time that human rights were given the priority they deserve, not only in theory but also in practice.

It is also quite a different matter to transport raw textiles weighing tons as compared to an enormous load of silk neckties - I had one for myself, by the way.



The proof is that three judges from the Constitutional Court were removed for opposing his re-election plans.
- The European Union has been at the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years.
In the first case, one problem that stands out is the inadequacy of support for actions designed to protect human rights, support for civil society and support for the media.
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.
The discussion of diversification requires a long-term debate.

It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.
I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue.

It means that a fixed link is being created between Scandinavia and the continent.

As honourable Members will also know, she is coming to the committee next week in order to have a full exchange with Members, many of whom will, of course, have shared in the success achieved last week.
First of all, the projects lack a legal basis.



We obviously cannot anticipate the results of the IGC, so we have to stick to current Treaty rules.

The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy.
Development ministers are not that unproblematic either.

It may simply be a matter of coordination; it may be a matter of establishing minimum requirements; it may also be a matter, at a higher level, of harmonisation.



Every one of us would want to welcome the small indication of progress that comes after the meetings with Secretary of State Slater and Ambassador Morningstar.
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.
I can well understand people' s being tired of all the fraud and therefore demanding that we have a common public prosecutor' s office.


We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.


I also hope that, in the future, we shall be able to conduct a similar open dialogue with the Commission regarding development within this sector.
The other and last message is that yes, we have the road-map. But we need more precision from the road-map.
Closer cooperation, at least as we view it, must comprise two main elements.

Fortunately, there are men who are talented and fervent supporters of the rights and interests that are close to our hearts.

There has never been any question of authorising polygamous family groupings, contrary to what I have just heard.

I should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade.
We were not very happy with the early versions from the rapporteur because we felt the targets were there to almost micro-manage the market in renewable energy sources.
I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer, Commissioner Reding, because I know that information is also of great interest to you: an interest which we share, moreover, because we are both journalists by profession.
But money is no substitute for political will and political influence.
It is a long road along which we must continue to make progress, until such time as it is so normal to find women in the positions which have always been occupied by men that reports such as this are no longer necessary.




is it possible to install ubuntu over the network from the i386 install cd?


This is why the European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, confirming the outcome of the first reading in the previous legislative period, have proposed that every vessel entering a Member State port should bear 90% of the costs of waste disposal and management, regardless of the actual use made of the facilities.
The main message is that the individual should be at the centre of the EU' s policies.

I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.
We have a good law and the saying "if a thing ain' t broken, don' t fix it; but do not be complacent about it either" applies here.
Illegal immigrants are engaged in illicit work, but industrial law regulations are not the way to go about tackling this problem.

Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.

Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.

First of all, they had to establish a common language and then compare results in order to share experiences, whilst leaving each Member State with full responsibility for its own education system.

We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.



We know that there is an increase in illegal migratory movement, for the most part controlled by criminal networks that often create situations involving exploitation and blatant violation of human rights.

In 1948, when Sri Lanka obtained independence, it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia.

I do not necessarily mean financial resources.
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.


That was clearly used as a political battering ram.
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.
It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed.

I intend to deal mainly with the Malmström and Belder reports and my colleague, Commissioner Vitorino, will deal with the other two important reports, although there will obviously be some overlap between us.

The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.
I should like to comment briefly on the complaints filed by the Commission against the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank.
On the one hand, I am an old opponent of nuclear power and have for many years been a member of the board of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate. On the other hand, I am chairman of the Delegation to the Joint EU-Czech Republic Parliamentary Committee.

This is why, in the Environment Committee, the European People' s Party supported the amendment of Article 9a of the directive for official animal nutrition inspections, which grants the European Commission the right of initiative in cases of acute danger, empowering them to independently initiate measures in line with the severity of the grievance and within the framework of proportionality.
We will present our proposals in the next few weeks.



For these reasons, we voted against the Deprez report.

Given the requests that the government and the opposition have already made we would also like the Commission to tell us how it intends to support the forthcoming electoral process and whether it will be sending a mission to observe the elections that have already been scheduled for this year.


I appreciate we have obligations under the treaties to two different locations but we should make sure that these are not expanded.


Nevertheless, I would like to make some specific points. The first is that I consider that the Commission should have taken account of the fact that complementarity is not an isolated element, but should rather be dealt with within a context of a global strategy which also addresses the issues of coordination and coherence, since coherence is inseparable from coordination and complementarity, and, without coordination, complementarity is not possible.
That was not an isolated incident, and it is still happening today.
I would also like to give special thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Member States, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as Great Britain, Spain and Ireland.
The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, has been distributed.
It really is discouraging to see the achievements of an entire decade put at risk.


With regard to necessary future investments in new technology and new equipment for the military, we think that these should be made possible through changes to the order of priorities in the national defence budgets.




I shall continue to remind you of the worrying predictions made by scientists regarding the climate change that is, to a great extent, caused by road transport.

Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.
We give money to the KEDO project as Mr Patten has said, we give humanitarian and food aid and are hoping to give other structural assistance, a total of EUR 275 m.
Out of respect for the Danish opt out in the legal sphere, the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have abstained from voting in the final vote on the proposal.


B5-0640/2000 by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in the Solomon Islands;
It is rather a question of nipping in the bud any vague desires which nations might have to oppose the destruction of their identity.
lostmonk: u in windows?

The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.

That is a point that deserves serious consideration.


As for the matter of fisheries and globalisation, it must be recognised that the low level of Community self-sufficiency in fisheries products has encouraged the liberalisation of trade sooner and more fully than in other sectors. While the nature of fishing itself, the growing nationalisation of fisheries or other circumstances may have their own particular features, they also have effects similar to those of globalisation and can have an especially hard social impact, with sometimes serious effects on working conditions or the displacement of fishery-related activities.
Therefore, Commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?
From the joint motion for a resolution, I would like to highlight some of the proposals - please excuse any repetition - which I believe the European Commission should take note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution: a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures; the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space, which is not in conflict with local and regional measures.
It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments.

In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.
First of all, criticism was levelled at the Commission for not deploying sufficient resources and staff and for a Brussels-based management which is too centralised.


The principle of polluter pays is not working in the case in point, because the polluter cannot be identified.
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?

Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?
The economic situation is positive, but the legislative adaptation of its Central Bank is not being carried out and it is not a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS.

i still havent figured out how to listen to music -_-

However, it is clear from his own report that BNFL cannot be trusted.
Subject: Subsidies for growing tobacco Tobacco growing in the European Union is subsidised to the tune of millions of euros per year while at the same time over half a million EU citizens die each year of diseases caused by tobacco.


We must convince Member States of the need to change the Treaty to create a centralised jurisdiction for Community patent litigation.

The report says that there is no end to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka.
We wish the vice-president much luck and success, so that come October we can submit an excellent programme.



I have found it remarkably difficult to get important documents and information from it on a number of occasions, especially for various budget lines relating to culture.
unless i go all the way back to like apple IIe or vic 20




These spring conferences, which will take place each year, will be important in terms of assessing progress made and developing future strategies.


Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.

martin_,  you have ubuntu running now?
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study.
The answer cannot be not to speed up developments in the direction of an eEurope.
how stable is hoary this day? any outstanding issue?
. (FR) Mr President, I feel that I should respond, because Mr Liese asked a specific question during the debate.
The summit was variously described as a social summit and an e-summit and so on.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency.
Our conscience will not allow anything else, nor will our electorate.

At the same time I have been following the French President' s ideas on how the countries of the European Union should develop at their own pace and on how there should possibly be a hard and solid core of pioneer states.



While it may, admittedly, be quite laudable to seek to obtain the most advantageous prices for consumers, we must still be able to compare like with like, particularly in terms of manufacturing conditions (social legislation, child protection).



In its document on the broad economic guidelines, the Commission pursues this liberal approach, and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States.
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.
As the President of the Commission knows, the current Union Treaty provides for a sort of relationship between the European Parliament and the Commission, whereby, although responsibility for legislative initiative lies with the Commission, it must take account of the positions of Parliament in drawing up legislation.
This is extremely regrettable because it will give third-party creditors the opportunity to gain access to the general resources as a result, which will mean that mortgages ordered abroad for the benefit of the bank will no longer be competitive.

Together with our friends from the UDB, I would argue in favour of two important guidelines relating to the complete overhaul of the world' s merchant navy and the protection of the Breton coast (proposals also to be found in the draft resolution which has just been approved).

The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry.







Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.
All I can suggest is a belt-and-braces approach. If you want to ensure that there is a roll call, make a request on behalf of your own group as well.

The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.
Also, there was the risk, in the article on the regulated markets, that the exception was more comprehensive than the main rule.
Our main concern has been that we do not end up discussing this type of event again. Preventative measures are the answer to the question of what can we do.

It is also important to try to correct the situation where things have gone wrong, but in so doing not to exaggerate it in such a way as to create in the European public's mind an image of a European Union that is out of control, that is a sea of corruption and cannot be trusted with taxpayers' money.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McNally sincerely for her excellent work, as this issue is a very important one. We are all agreed on this matter.

Equally clearly, President Kim Dae-Jung has been very realistic about what can be achieved in the short term.



I mean, rather, that we feel concerned, many of us very directly, by this challenge, particularly, let me tell you, as Commissioner for Regional Policy, when I am signing agreements and working with the Member States and the regions on the content and the quality of programming documents in each of the Member States. I am entirely prepared to make room for the question of lifelong education and training and, in general, educational matters, in Structural Fund programmes.


For example, what credibility does Belgium have in this area when it is expelling large numbers of gypsy asylum-seekers to Slovakia and Bulgaria, despite Parliament' s recommendations and the express request of the European Court of Human Rights?
I did not indicate my request to speak earlier because one of the administrators of our Group had, before the sitting, already indicated to the President and Bureau that I wanted to table a point of order.

Let me comment on some details of your report.
Of course the Dresden bombings in the Great War may not have been necessary and may have been criminal, but the truth is that you do not gloss over this: you communists will not leave us alone with your pacifist line-up.
We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth. Something born of a Harvard University lecture theatre under the presidency of the American, General Marshall, is bound to end up obeying its creator.
Therefore, in the review which is carried out, it is essential that we remember not only the consumers - who in any event must make their own decisions and must use mechanisms for encrypting and protecting their data in accordance with laws and with technology - but also the SMEs, because otherwise there will soon be little electronic commerce in Europe.



As to the issue of extradition, I wish to assure Mr Ferri that I share the concerns expressed in his report with regard to the simplification and acceleration of extradition procedures, which are, in fact, the theme of the third stage of mutual evaluation.

Crane: i've got firefox .93 but latest is v1

smurfix: you're up
It means a step in the direction of see-through man and yet more state interference in our private lives.
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.

The regulations on the limitation of discharges are gradually being reinforced.
The same thing is happening in the nearby Solomon Islands and all over the world.
And, in addition, there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights.

Biodiversity is also affected, and the situation of various plant species is worrying.

I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.
Frankly this does not appear to be the case.

But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.
The progress reports that the Commission is due to submit in the autumn will reveal that the candidate countries have made an enormous amount of progress and are approaching the stage when they will be ready for accession.
The former must adapt their national legislation according to environment protection and precautionary principles and the latter must adapt their techniques in order to eradicate and not just displace the problem of pollution.
wood1: yeah, i hear fax uses port 6667.


Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.
This would essentially mean maintaining the existing position, so that is in fact another argument as to why these amendments cannot be accepted.

Again, Britain's Labour Government is leading the way.
You said that the Treaty would be signed within a month.
Bangladesh must facilitate the re-admission of nationals who are illegally in the territory of an EU Member State.

With our rapid reaction facility one is very often talking about advisors, mediators, observers, customs officials, police officers, and so on.

Lastly: the Commission' s Work Programme seems to overlook two sectors which are in need of particular attention from the European institutions, especially in the light of the developments constantly taking place in e-commerce.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has on several occasions made considerable contributions to the debate on the European Union' s Mediterranean policy and on reinvigorating the 1995 Barcelona Process.
A result of this is the discussion on the directive on the use of green electricity - electricity from renewable sources - or our collaboration with the Directorate-General for Competition on the question of the processing of aid to these kinds of sectors.
An ambitious government plan will be presented soon in Spain, the National Hydrological Plan, which will have a clear impact on the places where it is put into practice.
Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded.
It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology.
It was a great achievement on our part to secure an increase in the funding from EUR 54.4 million to EUR 93 million - i.e. it was practically doubled - even though we know that we would need a much larger amount to do justice to the importance of this issue in terms of our common future.
Mr President, Commissioner. I share all the concerns expressed by previous speakers.



I would like to finish off with this observation. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.




Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.

Madam President, Mr Murphy was speaking about Mr Hannan' s ill-timed interference in the Danish election campaign.
However, we are also aware that sport can sometimes be accompanied by horrific acts of violence, abominable racist outbursts and unacceptable strident nationalism.

Direct dialogue between the parties is essential.

In the case of the audiovisual sector, clear and, most importantly, timely legal instruments will mean that the institutions are able to regulate these changes: to provide better protection for the public and for users, establish the necessary restrictions to protect minors, lay down new rules to protect copyright and set regulations in place before certain developments occur, such as the fact that electronic commerce will soon be taking place via the medium of television.
By German or Italian reckoning, the amount must seem tiny.
Many people felt that this regulation should be passed as quickly as possible, which has meant Parliament having to distance itself from many of its proposed amendments.

We must nevertheless bear in mind that there are many factors that contribute to damaging marine areas, such as contamination and pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, the pressure of human activity on coastal waters and, of course, uncontrolled fishing activity.
Subject to this condition, then, what this directive proposes is Europe' s initial model response to the legitimate feeling aroused due to the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika.







That is the potential conflict which could arise between this Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights.
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.



My fourth point is to stress the urgent need to adopt the Charter for Security and Stability so that we can play a more active role, particularly in restoring peace in the Middle East. We consider it particularly important to encourage local measures and sustainable development, although this was omitted from the Feira Council conclusions, and to carry out progressive evaluation in this area, to implement major programmes on the environment and water, to reinvigorate the Start programme, and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the Sixth Research Framework Programme of research and technological development.
We must increase employment in the sector consisting of services which facilitate business initiative and reduce the administrative burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises, reducing non-wage costs. Lastly, we have to promote the integration of general equal opportunities policies for all men and women, with particular stress on aspects which help to reconcile professional life with family life.
okay, sweet deal then :)
This right to be informed is the natural counterpart to the development of trade and the proper exercise of competition.


But Parliament will defend the view in the codecision procedure that the positions taken do not go far enough in order to safeguard the long-term future of the railways.
Therefore, one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives.
The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying a few words about humanitarian assistance to this region.


There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance.

Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.

We are in favour of granting Wahid support, because the moment we involve international observers or commit other forms of aid without Wahid' s knowledge, we will be intervening and undermining his actions.

Having said that, let me repeat, Turkey' s candidacy has been accepted on equal terms with regard to both rights and duties.
Mr President, could I start my contribution by offering my congratulations to Commissioner Monti and his officials for the scrupulous and professional way in which they dealt with the proposed MCI Worldcom - Sprint merger.
The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed.


Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions.

The unwarranted seizure and subsequent detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party, together with local youth leaders, last Saturday, cannot in any way be justified by claims that they need 'protection' .

I therefore hope that, in June, our ministers will be able to approve the rapid establishment of a whole series of building sites in Europe, on the basis of the Commissioner' s proposals.

The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.

The same must be demanded of Parliament as of all the others, but this is our House, we have more information and we can therefore take a different approach when it comes to proposing, as the Kuhne report does, a conditional discharge and not a postponement of the discharge.

A substance as toxic as heparin, a rat poison, turns out to be an effective anticoagulant which has saved many lives.

For WTO negotiations, a specific mandate from the Council is required therefore the present regulation does not seem to be the appropriate means of determining the Union' s position.


Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.
This is cause for serious concern, particularly for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and we are also very concerned by the serious difficulties encountered during these four months by the Portuguese Presidency in its endeavour to define satisfactory solutions for the three issues left unresolved after Amsterdam, particularly the issue of qualified majority voting.



read the INSTALL
Let me assure you that such amendments do not cause any particular problem because their purpose is to reinforce the administrative procedure.

I pointed out yesterday during the vote on the directive to combat money laundering the English translation of Article 6(3) needs to be corrected to bring it in line with Amendment No 26, because the English translation is wrong.


Would it not lose all credibility if it did not also criticise similar events within its borders?

I promise, Mr President, to be extremely brief.
Mr President, honourable Members, we need to differentiate in our assessment of the financial repercussions of the BSE crisis between veterinary measures, Community measures taken within the context of the common organisation of the market in beef and national measures.

But what funding must be sought?

One might even say that Europe has entrusted the task of a military presence to the NATO leadership and, at the same time, relaxed its efforts over the years, to the point at which it is now more or less incapable of properly honouring its obligations within NATO.
By means of Articles 20a to 20d, they are re-introduced in the report, but this time by using the same wording as in the other two directives.

Madam President, we must also stop pussyfooting around.
It is the duty of confirmed Europeanists such as ourselves, who believe in the social market economy, to fight the scourge of unemployment, and in order to do this Europe must encourage the small and medium-sized businesses and foster the development of trade, agriculture, tourism and craft trades, but, in the context of subsidiarity, it must also reduce the burden of taxation.
We need to take account of that in our calculations.
Research involving cloning techniques for reproductive or therapeutic ends is therefore quite explicitly excluded.
I would like to add a few important points.

from all of the lines in that text file?
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.
Many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity.
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.

Consequently, not only do we refuse to vote in favour of any resources whatsoever, human or financial, for this army, but we protest against its very existence.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)

The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0375/2000), by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council recommendation on European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education [11540/1/2000 - C5-0565/2000 - 2000/0022(COD)].
However, the Commission proposal approaches the problem from the angle of competition and the profits of the aviation industry and the airlines.

My first comment is that it has been possible to implement the main provisions of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, even if somewhat belatedly in relation to the original timetable. The second redeployment was completed on 24 March 2000, i.e. just over two months after the original deadline.
It is not a problem involving the practices of people who carry out their work in conditions of great tension, difficulty and complexity, and who do everything possible to guarantee the highest possible level of safety. This is the main problem: how to guarantee the highest possible level of safety.
Fortunately, that criticism and reluctance is now a thing of the past; unfortunately, however, we still hear some reservations, like those voiced in Parliament just now.
Caring for your neighbour is also a Christian enjoinder.
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime. With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.
It concerns the question, raised repeatedly today, as to whether the European Union should sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights.
A strong Directive which deals with concerns about the environment and the health risks of GMOs could go a long way to ensure we realise the potential benefits from GMOs and avoid the pitfalls.

Of course, we have a lot of lost ground to make up, because in the past we have only had national railways.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.
I prefer to have my partners in the south well on board in the process, also taking into consideration the risk of the negative spill-over in the region.


Firstly, because this key aspect is struggling along lethargically, with vague impulses served up in the form of speeches, witness the so very insipid Barcelona Process, this pathetic alibi for our basic indifference.

As you will be aware, elections were held in Mexico last Sunday.

Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.

There are many practical proposals for the implementation of the programme and some of Parliament' s concerns shine through these amendments. I must say the Commission broadly shares them, just as I share most of the views expressed this evening, here in the House.

In my opinion, the implementation of this agreement will undoubtedly take the European Union and Mexico down a road which offers hope of improving the income levels and quality of life of the communities involved at a time and under circumstances which, despite the distances, evoke the legendary meeting between Suchil and Quetzalcoatl, immortalised in Don Salvador de Madariaga' s "El Corazón de Piedra Verde" .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.
And this Parliament has been calling for optimum use of funds for years.
There is a serious risk of this, and, if we wish to maintain a political presence, in the region, in conflict management and risk prevention, we must do more and better in the future than we have done in the recent past.



Mr President, there were approximately one hundred military conflicts in the Nineties, the majority of which were civil wars.

The Commission welcomes the new initiatives being taken against HIV/Aids by some countries to produce cheaper generic drugs and would like to offer its support to help such countries provide technical assistance to other developing countries to enable them to pursue such initiatives.
The commitment of the countries in the region to implement institutional policy reforms and to create an environment allowing economic progress is a fundamental element in this Pact.
Finally, several Members - Mrs Read, Mr Markov, Mrs Ainardi, Mr Rapkay - have recognised and stressed the beneficial impact of the development of this sector on employment, but also expressed some concern about the social impact of mergers.

I am aware of the more or less unanimous feeling of the European Parliament about the restrictive nature of this Charter.

The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.




I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.
installing ubuntu on my Mom's Inspiron 8200 (Dell)


I can assure you, Mr Campos, that the interaction that takes place at Commission level on these issues puts a high premium on food safety.
I would like to conclude by expressing my satisfaction at the decision, also adopted in Turin, to reopen the Mount Blanc road tunnel after the summer.

These realisations have resulted in the European Union' s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy.



An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.
One of the means to do so would perhaps be, in future, to boost the emphasis on the rural development arm of the CAP, which was started in Berlin.

Mr President, Commissioner, a speaker in this House yesterday expressed the view that economic globalisation is not an incontrovertible necessity but the evil outworking of a few multinationals.

Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.
Earlier this year, as well as that presentation to foreign ministers, I hope that I gave the European Parliament exactly the same candid presentation on our external relations budget.

Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .

Mr Byrne, we must not allow animals which are not being tested now to be slaughtered, because we urgently need these results for diagnostic reasons - as Mr Böge has already said - in order to evaluate the overall threat of BSE in Europe.

Mr Jonathan Faull, formerly Head of the Press and Communications Service, will henceforth - and for a transitional period - act as the Commission Spokesman.
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.
However, it is only interested in transparency with regard to public undertakings and only in terms of finding out whether state aid distorts competition between public and private undertakings.

All I can say is that so far, she has throughout the discussions shown herself to be a worthy opponent.




This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.
The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General, Mr David O' Sullivan, raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train.

The next item is the Commission communication "Additional Commission contribution to the IGC on institutional reform: qualified majority for taxation and social security aspects of the internal market".



tar, I agree.
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.

If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.

As I said, the European Union has been monitoring this situation. In the General Affairs Council the day before yesterday the Commission presented a report on the current situation in the Horn of Africa and specifically tackled one point of the humanitarian situation.

(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)

I would ask you to insist that Mr Murphy either accuse me outright or apologise.
First was the issue of definition.




The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.

I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.
i burn mine as fast as the media will go

Mr President, the ELDR Group is backing this report as one of the essential building blocks in constructing the area of freedom, security and justice and in following up the Tampere Summit, which rightly made it a priority to establish rights of free movement for legally resident third-country nationals.

This time we have proposals for agreements with Guinea and Mauritius, which will have similar effects.

Yeah.
I myself consider it a good thing for us also to be promoting development measures in connection with fisheries.
the default size is 48x48 like normal pixmap icons.   lila, gartoon and the industrial gnome-vfs icons  are all 92x92 I think

Although I did not join the European Parliament until last year, I happen to know that the handling of this annual human rights report has, over the past couple of years, always met with a great deal of political commotion and confusion.



However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.

Ladies and gentlemen, I find the outcome of this Summit very encouraging, and I would like to stress once again the Commission' s commitment to ensuring the swift, efficient implementation of the decisions taken at the European Council.
I believe we have reached a good compromise.
It is only because of Mr Nikitin, and the independent media, which face increased repression, that we heard about the disaster at all, four days after the event.Thanks to international support, it was at least possible to avoid the very worst and I hope that it will also be possible to find a solution.
It is our opinion that it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs, but that it is also possible to do so.
As the questioner indicates, we should ask whether the restriction associated with the expression 'essentially all products' may be retained for very much longer as soon as we consider granting these countries total access to our markets.
It is a matter of real concern because it is made to appear as though a scheme which is supposed to provide specific help really ends up just been a conjuring trick between the Commission and the national governments in which extra money is supposed to be coming in, but we are told afterwards it makes no difference whether extra money went into the particular region as long as it went into the country as a whole.
We wish to ensure that the Community has effective means to support this restructuring at Community level.



It radiates crisis on every side.

bob2: only the part that conflicted 
Let us be clear what we are talking about.

But the Council must also show willing.



It is not just a question of passivity and sins of omission.
What kind of hardware do you have on there?


(B5-0387/2000) by Mrs Schroedter, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the armed conflict in the Republic of Chechnya.




They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.
The level of cooperation and the forms of collaboration between the Commission and NGOs are of particular concern to all Ministers without portfolio whose programmes are implemented through NGOs and who have, I would say, a special burden to bear in the social field.


It therefore sought the agreement of the Zimbabwean authorities to send, as far in advance of the elections as possible, a large mission of nearly 200 observers, thereby demonstrating the Union' s interest in seeing democracy consolidated in that country.
Universities and companies therefore need to work more closely together.

Export refunds are an important instrument in sustaining the industry' s competitiveness by compensating for high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union.

By having its own embassy, a country can also provide important services to its citizens when they visit another country.
I want to wish the new Commissioner well in her first budget and say that I sincerely hope that we can have a smooth and effective procedure in which all of us will do the best we can to produce a sensible budget in a most efficient way.

Of course we shall still have fires and, with what is happening to the climate, we shall no doubt be unfortunate enough to witness more and more serious phenomena.

The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vitality, economic prosperity and international influence.
The price to be paid for this, by African farmers in particular, is too high.
Parliament and the Commission should ask the Council about this issue so that greater coherence can be achieved in all legislation.


It was, and is, to Mr Söderman' s credit that he has done so much to create greater transparency and openness within the European administrations.
This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union.




I believe that the mission constituted the most credible observer voice during these critical times in Zimbabwe.
If we postpone our vote, the tobacco industry will gain even more time, since the Council will then not be able to state its position until the end of June.
ssh is the way to go
As the authors are not present, Question Nos 6 and 7 lapse.
yes.. my first time using linux in general

Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.
It seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind Mr Patten's proposal for the rapid reaction facility.
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.


It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.
You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment.
In this sense, my question meant exactly that, given that we are dealing with economies which, because of the economic system in place, used to function along different trading, or rather bartering lines. The question which I am basically asking is what can be done to ensure that products from these regions reach the markets of the Member States of the European Union?
As we so often speak about bringing citizens closer to the institutions, this is surely one of the ways to achieve this aim.

It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.
This type of situation will become inevitable if this amendment is put into practice.
I cannot therefore accept the amendments in question, which are Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12.
Yes, Madam President, and furthermore, I would be grateful if, on such a sensitive issue, the rapporteur could speak on the basis of the question, as she is required to do.

That is an appalling fact for us to take on board.
So longhorn is the next release of X Windows?
We should like to suggest that, since this is a very important process and moment in our legislative cycle, and to enable the Commission and Parliament to approach it in a constructive way, the annual state of the Union address could be combined with a resolution from Parliament on key political priorities and then go to the committees for more detailed debate.


I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, the problem with this report is that it amounts to a retrospective review of a chapter in the history of the Structural Funds which has long since been closed, during the previous parliamentary term in fact.



Therefore, Commissioner, the extension of these improvement plans, as long as they are organised, used, and allocated according to a differentiated treatment in the coming reform of fruits, which will happen shortly, I believe that this will resolve and calm the fears which Mr Jové has expressed, which are shared by all the nut producers in the European Union, as they communicated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where they received our political support.



In taking this step, the EU wished to express its conviction that the Peruvian election could not have the democratic legitimacy that it would have had in normal circumstances, and which this country urgently needed.
I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr Söderman, the Ombudsman.

It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.


Indeed, the work we have done has already gained and secured widespread support.



Mr President, this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate.
That is what this is about, and that alone!

The other amendments are already more or less reflected in the text or in other amendments.
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.

Moreover, we must not be intimidated but take pride in the entire audiovisual sector in the digital age as a great vehicle of freedom, information and movement of ideas.


I should like to ask him how he envisages disaster relief of the kind that was needed in Mozambique recently - how would this rapid reaction facility liaise and collaborate with Member States' armies and navies?
Subject: EU-China WTO Agreement Is the Council aware that China has ordered state-run television, newspapers, and billboard owners to stop running Sprite commercials featuring the young pop-star, Sherry Chang Huei-mei, who sang at the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bain?

But obviously this political symbolism can in no way allay our concern about environmental issues, social issues and above all human rights issues, and many speakers have already referred to them here today.

Greece has to do two things, and the Greek Government is prepared to do them and has committed itself to doing them: Firstly, it must continue with its liberalisation policies and structural reforms which will improve the inflation situation; secondly, Greece must continue with its policy of reducing the deficit, but in a context of combining policies, a 'policy mix' , which will allow it, in the event that an increase in demand, resulting from a reduction in interest rates, may create tension in terms of inflation, to reconsider its tax policy so that it will not have negative effects on the process of integration into Monetary Union.
I am referring to the case mentioned previously by my colleague Mr Marset, the British submarine Tireless, which has been anchored in the port of Gibraltar since May, where the intention is to repair it.
I also hope that our liberal colleagues will perhaps reconsider before tomorrow whether they might not - including for reasons of parliamentary identity - join us once again as they did in the first and also in the second reading, because we will then be going into the conciliation procedure anyway and there we will have to see how much ground the Council can give.
Calculations of the economic costs of traffic accidents show that they are considerably higher than the costs of preventing traffic accidents.
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.

They make up between 1 and 2.5% of the population over there, according to a recent German press source.
We use every possible opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the State Peace and Development Council to enter into a substantive dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities.

There will certainly be a great deal to do in that area.
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices.
We understand from the Peers Group report that you are going to be awarded an extra 92 posts.

I will relay it to Commissioner Verheugen.

This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.
That is why it is of the utmost importance that we should do everything to ensure transparency finally reaches Russia.






This is also something that the older generation, who are generally so sceptical about the euro, could do.





Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)
But one should remember that, between 1982 and 1992, the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked; they are getting less now, and there was a generous amount of money.


This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.



To be frank, it showed that the evaluation culture, which is a modern, necessary culture, is making progress.
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.


Perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect. I hope, at the same time, to comment on the amendments which have been tabled.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency' s ship is heavily-laden and we hope, particularly having heard Mr Chirac' s answers, that it arrives safely in Nice, in six months.
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.


mako: go ahead

Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.


You can be satisfied with the progress made.



will xfce4 go on this
The framework agreement also contravenes our own rules of procedure.



It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed.

Let us be logical about this.

It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.



At the same time, I want to support a good deal of what Mrs Iivari said about minority language areas.

I take the point about the Commission's proposals and I look forward to discussing this further with the Commission when we have a result from Copenhagen.
The implementing provisions for this regulation are being enacted under the committee procedure.

We therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the Committee on Agriculture.
gui stands for graphic user interface?


If the Danish proposals were to be implemented, those who put unsafe vessels on our seas would think twice.
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.
Whilst I appreciate that MEPs are amongst the worst culprits for excessive cabin baggage, I would hope their sense of responsibility would enable them to recognise that a problem exists, that this problem compromises safety and that Amendment No 16 should be supported.




We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.
The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States.

It is evident that our political models cannot simply be transplanted.
The volume of undeclared work now corresponds to 15% of gross domestic product in the EU.


Although one swallow does not make a summer, in this case the French Government gave precedence to reason and caution over the ideology of the single market.

Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.
In what form will the European Union be present and at what level?

When I presented the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 in February, I announced that one of our major objectives would be to develop a new economic and social agenda for Europe.

Well I hope you guys don't mind me hanging out even though I'm not using ubuntu
That is an abuse of the position that we hold here.
We are now rapidly turning to the information society, information technology, the Internet, the Galileo network for monitoring and intercommunication by satellite, the liberalisation and convergence of telecommunications and technological advances in general.
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.
Mr President, over a period of 150 years, missionaries and aid workers have fostered knowledge of international affairs and commitment in my own country amongst broad sections of the population.
Amaranth: heh, i know :)
The word "impossible" has been used about the directive. I should like to say, however, that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present.

Our citizens expect no less than that, and we must live up to their expectations.
I would like to thank everyone for their comments but I agree most with the comment made by Mr Hänsch.
Even if we harmonise legislation, public health should not be compromised in any way.




stuNNed_: you don't happen to have a toshiba, do you?
This directive will now apply in all countries which are members of the green card system, meaning that approximately 90% of all accidents in which Europeans might be involved will be covered.
My last point is this: of course we are also aware in this House that the question of Turkey, including its relations with Greece, is bound up with the Cyprus issue.

If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.
They left a question mark over whether and how to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties.

Tunisia is our neighbour, because the Mediterranean does not divide, it unites us.
We have not yet reached that point, but we did hear how Russian society is currently becoming more radical from an expert this morning.

These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way.
In the area of good governance and the rule of law, both parties demonstrated their commitment to adopting specific measures to prevent and combat bribery, corruption and nepotism.

I shall also do my best to ensure that the facts we have available at any given time are forwarded to the House.




Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.
More competitive does not mean more predatory but simply more efficient at using the resources actually available, and doing this better than everyone else.


But I can imagine that other people would argue against this, saying: no, it is important to be involved in this as a Union.
There are at least 16 million businesses within the EU, 99.9% of them are micro to medium-sized.


We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance.
Yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people.
The Commission has noted that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs is looking into the incident and into possible compensation.


You cannot argue that this is an important form of agriculture if it is obviously not important enough for the regional authorities to give it priority and grant support for it.

Despite all the sympathy that can be felt towards the possibility of exempting young people taking part in European Union Youth Programmes from visa requirements, the Commission must stick to its aim of maximum harmonisation and avoid cases creating derogations from, or exceptions to, the visa requirement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all too often, Africa is seen by Europe as a lost continent, which is why this EU-Africa summit was long overdue.
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?
The Council, under the French Presidency intends to deal with several matters relating to sexual equality.

Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?


in the install I mean
The second aspect - which in my view is even more important than reconstruction aid - is aid for the prevention of disasters. That means we want to play our part in defining and initiating management programmes in relation to the natural risks in the federal states of Falcon Miranda and Jarakui.
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.
This is true, of course, because very often it is not the Ministers for Foreign Affairs who travel to Africa but rather the Ministers responsible for emergency aid who then pursue their policy from there.


The Commission should also be entitled to have confidential drafts on the table throughout the preparative phase.
The three points raised by Mr Heaton-Harris are the insufficient monitoring of projects, the granting of an extraordinary bonus to ECB employees and the refusal to be subject to OLAF investigations.



robtaylor: a guided tour? That'll be nice! :-)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow members have already picked up on the main points.


The vote will take place in a few minutes' time, at 5.30 p.m.
It is the question of the regulations that a web trader has to comply with for cross-border transactions.
Moreover, I should like to hear a still clearer statement.
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
For the benefit of colleagues I should perhaps explain that a quango is a recently-coined English word short for "quasi non-governmental organisation", in other words, a new piece of bureaucracy, more money spent, more jobs for the boys, more patronage for their bosses.
I do not want to go over the details of what Mr Ferri has already said, but it does mean that the candidate countries need to be fully involved in the strategy for fighting organised crime at an early stage.
These amendments seek to re-introduce a formal approval procedure for voluntary information on labels.

It is a crime against human dignity. It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals.
pitti: i found my bug.. inittab is all wrong
I will, of course, keep you updated on the reply that Mr Ries is bound to send me.
I turn now to the question of transparency. We note with great concern that through its activities the Council's General Secretariat has created a number of screens at top level, with the refusal to pass on information either to the Commission or to the European Parliament ­and Mr Solana, for whom I have a high regard, is of course more preoccupied with his job as High Representative.
During a previous debate on the information strategy to be pursued, I was already bound to make some critical observations with regard to the highly peculiar wishes of some of my fellow delegates.

I share the analysis of your motion for a resolution that governments should take advantage of the favourable economic environment in order to step up the efforts directed towards consolidating budgets and reducing public debt and go beyond the objectives laid down in the stability programmes.

So we are also looking forward to that partnership.
Although the success of the event depends in large measure on the commitment of the international community as a whole, the Council recognises that the European Union can and must play a major role in the preparations, a role encouraged during informal contacts held with representatives of UNICEF.

Within hours of his resignation, the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions.
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the situation of frontier workers.
We also want to improve the rapid alert system, a system which is operated by the Commission to monitor the information on dangerous products and measures taken.
I wish to subscribe to the thanks that have been expressed to the rapporteur and to emphasise that I have heard from insiders that the programme has so far been an unqualified success.
It was difficult to achieve this compromise, and the Council' s last minute attempts to water down the agreement are evidence of how ambitious it is and of the way it places Parliament and the Commission in a relationship of cooperation, where Parliament performs a monitoring function in line with its prerogatives while the Commission has a range of tasks to add to its primary role of guardian of the Treaties and proposer of initiatives.
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.
Madam President, before the vote I should like to make a point of order.

Indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance.

In the course of the centuries, women have demanded their rights as full citizens.



The members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group shall therefore be voting against this report which does not go into details of the deficiencies of the Commission communication and increases Natura 2000 constraints upon the fisheries sector.
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.

saif: Then just get Mono: A Developer
In a globalised world, human rights are no longer an internal affair and the general acknowledgement of the globalisation of human rights therefore needs to be strengthened further.
The separation of functions would lead to the liberalisation of air traffic service provision, establishing, as indeed the Atkins report states, a liberalised internal market.
As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.
In Lisbon, should we not establish a sort of technological convergence criterion requiring Member States, for example, within a five year period, to move towards a rate of expenditure on research and development equivalent to at least 2.5% of their GDP? This is still less than the level currently attained by the United States?
With all due respect and sympathy, Mr Oostlander, but since you refer to the cleaning-up operation, I notice that this is precisely one of those cornerstones of our reinforcement plan which is being removed.

There has been fruitful interinstitutional cooperation, and the codecision procedure has shown its strength.
We will have the same situation on Whit Monday.


Other Member States regard the current presidency proposal for a network as a temporary stage on the road to an institution at a fixed location.


No sign of anti-Semitic content has been found in these new books.
Moreover, Rule 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure provides for the organisation of public debates.
These freedoms have a special meaning in people' s lives, and through them people express their bond with specific values.
It is a little unrealistic to ask the Commission to ensure that paper prices in Europe are competitive.
The issue is crisis management and humanitarian actions which are commonly referred to in Community parlance as the 'Petersberg tasks' .
The basic problems concerned what the European Union has already included in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the difficulty which some countries had in accepting the issue of sexual rights and its inherent diversity and the issue of sexual orientation.
Hutch192: what's the killer feature 1.0 has that you want?


I believe that the proposals you will put forward in Lisbon, which should help to merge these infamous broad economic policy guidelines, these 'Employment' guidelines, to form guidelines for the European policy on growth and employment, mark a step in the right direction.

A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.
Those fears have recently been heightened by the discovery of GMO-contaminated cotton-seed imported from the USA into Greece for cotton production, which for the moment at least has no approval at all for commercial planting within the EU but nevertheless has found its way across our borders and into use in at least one Member State.
Mr President, like everyone else, I want to join in the praise of the Danish Government which has taken this initiative.
The Union would like to have fair cooperation with its partners, and now we all realise that we would have gained a lot if the Moroccan Government had responded in time to Community appeals.
(The sitting was closed at 10.10 a.m.)


rather than just kludging _nl onto the end of every page :)
Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union.

These are Articles 20(1)(h) and 20(2).
The next six months are clearly going to be busy, and I am convinced that by the time France hands over the torch to Sweden, we will have made very considerable progress in building the Europe our citizens want and expect.
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.

General product safety - BSE tests
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.


I hope that we can count on your support.
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.
This is why I fail to comprehend why a number of proposed amendments to my report claim that the Court' s judgement has strengthened the position of the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank in their opposition to the regulation.

Everything is now spelled out loud and clear, everyone is happy and I am delighted that, by joining forces, we have probably avoided a lengthy conciliation procedure.
There is absolutely no point in burying one' s head in the sand and always maintaining the opposite of what is in fact the case, on the principle that the more you insist on something, the closer it comes to becoming a reality.
We Portuguese can perhaps boast the richest mix of blood and ethnic origins in the course of history.

Fortunately, integral chain control (ICC) is already well-known in many countries.
If we had any specific information on this, the Council would not hesitate to adopt a clear position.
The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas.

The ageing of the population, together with the low birth-rate in the European Union, means that this is an issue of enormous importance for all social operators.
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons!
If it does, then we need to prepare for them, anticipate the challenges and how to respond to them and not fall into a situation of 'wait and see' , which would leave us trailing in the wake of events that we can neither prevent nor influence.

Such a document cannot be drafted, not now or in future, and this ambition is certainly not a task of the European Union.

The Commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the Union.

This was a simple exercise in thuggery by an administration acting in panic.
I think this is an excellent principle and I would like to see it applied in full, but not to traffic jams.
As you are aware, I visited Mozambique on 2 and 3 March, together with the Portuguese State Secretary, Mr Amado.
But one has to bear in mind two important facts about ECHO.


However, no one knows how great the danger and the insidious impact on people's health will be.


Madam President, it is with regret that I must rise this time to address the following point: we have been astounded by the content of a statement made by a Member of the Commission - Commissioner Verheugen - on the issue of the enlargement of the European Union.


I understand that it is related to the detailed analysis that you will make of the Commission text.


selinux for the big guys ;D

Mr President, last summer I went on holiday to Guinea-Bissau, and, as is my wont, I exchanged a few words with one of the local elderly pensioners, or rather with a fisherman from Guinea-Bissau would have dearly loved to have become a pensioner.

In the College of Quaestors we have also discussed - because we too are concerned - robberies that are taking place within Parliament.
Regrettably, very little attention has been paid to the role of NGOs, especially the local NGOs, both in terms of preparation and implementation. This is all the more unfortunate if one considers the level of knowledge regarding the Stability Pact in the region.



I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea.
martin_, settings > prefs
heh

At the moment there are currently nine other environment cases which have come back to the Court of Justice for a second time because countries have ignored earlier judgments.
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.
Lifelong learning is something we all look upon with the greatest benevolence.
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.

This subject matter will seem somewhat dry after the eloquent presentation delivered by the Chairman of our Committee on Budgets.
Rules are rules, but if there is no effective punishment after breaking them, they become weaker and unenforceable, so we need to see a solid legal basis to develop the possible imposition of sanctions.
The country' s regime, which is also culpable, has managed to squeeze every last drop out of the negotiations in this matter.

The oil for food programme started in 1996 has been excessively bureaucratic and incompetent, resulting in long delays in procuring essential medicines and food supplies.

Having said this, the presidency considers that everything must be done to create an area of freedom, security and justice at European level.
Secondly, in addition to agreeing to the minimum level of technical harmonisation proposed in the report, the preparation of ex ante cost-benefit analyses and the order of priorities for drawing up TSIs, my group sets particular store by including the social partners, associations and organisations, passengers and users in the work of drafting and checking technical specifications for interoperability.



Relations between the European Union and NATO are converging so quickly that the non-aligned countries are in a very precarious situation, although they want to make a full contribution to the promotion of national security.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber.

She kept on asking the Commission for more and more information, going beyond the recommendations made in the resolution adopted on 13 April.
In terms of order of size, it may perhaps be a little more, but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve.

Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it, which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles, based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and, consequently, also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free, and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation.

Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.
For the aforesaid reasons, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report, since we basically think it is extremely important to combat racism and xenophobia.


Greece does not have to beg to be allowed into the euro zone; it is fully qualified to join the States that will introduce the euro as an effective and definitive means of payment in 2002.
I will not dwell on this as the matter will be discussed later on when Mr Solana is here.


Report without debate (A5-0379/2000) by Mr Bowe, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the implementation of Directive 96/59/EC on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCBs and PCTs) [2000/2112(INI)]

The OAU must be given international support to continue its work and the peace initiatives must come from the African countries themselves.

The ban is based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee that toys containing certain phthalates pose a risk to children's health when held in the mouth for extensive periods of time.
We are starting to ask ourselves what we get in return for this money - swine fever, hormone-treated calves, dioxin-infested hens and now the BSE epidemic.
I am firmly convinced that the political will that was present in this agreement will also be present when it comes to implementing it.




Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.

We want to know for some of the special cases which we have not been able to cover this time, like gambling - the effect on national lotteries - pharmaceuticals and books, the real problems that they are having.



The key challenges for the month ahead will be continued support to Montenegro, the strengthening of the Serbian civil society and the Serbian media, support of the Kosovo elections and to UNMIK and support for regional integration.
Mr President, I would like, on behalf of the committee, to move at least one of the oral questions.
The law of Italy has not yet been brought into conformity with it, to satisfy their rights.
The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are, in my view, still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief.


As to the shape of individual national military contributions, these will be discussed at the pledging conference to be held in the autumn under the French presidency.
For that reason the work is important and calls for stringent budgetary discipline.
We stand ready to help them both to achieve peace and to build on the foundations that a peace settlement would lay.

That is all very well, but even the new regulations only allow for assessment of additionality at a national level and not at a regional level.

In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.
Mr President, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are completely incompatible with the European Union' s political principles.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you, and also the Commission, for your help.


We must continue to promote solidarity between States.
Furthermore, in this respect, I believe that the effort of the rapporteurs in drawing up the original draft and seeking a compromise through the amendments will lead to a position which should be taken into account by this Parliament and by the national governments.
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.
The Commission has already proposed communitising all existing conventions not currently in force, particularly the one on the service of documents and the Brussels II Convention and the convention on bankruptcies.

Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).

This is not the first time that pardons or honours for torturers have been granted or awarded by the Spanish authorities.


For this reason, the European Union must firmly denounce these proceedings and, having recognised the extent to which democracy has deteriorated, promote a series of measures which will help to overcome the current situation and lead to the repetition of the elections with full safeguards in place.
We must move towards establishing public Europe-wide services within the framework of a common policy...
what sound card?
Those who know me know that I am not a blind advocate of genetic engineering.

Second, my thanks also to the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for supporting this important reform project.

Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.

What public opinion sees is a few declarations condemning certain aspects of the war in Chechnya; what we are actually seeing is political and financial support for the Kremlin.
GOD
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome. So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.

And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.

I will conclude by pointing out that there is no point in adopting stringent legislation if it does not provide an efficient supervision system which rewards honest producers and penalises those whose improper conduct jeopardises the future of an entire sector which is of primary importance for the European economy.

I would like to underline to you, as I have done in my report, a number of points that I feel strongly about.
The situation in Kosovo has got considerably worse, not least because the Albanians are concerned about the fate of their fellow countrymen in Serbian prisons.

I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding.
We can support the need to draw up a common code of conduct for arms dealing between Member States and between Member States and third countries, but we cannot support the creation of an internal market for the armaments industry, as also proposed in the resolution.
It has not been abandoned, it is just that it is an enormously complex project, ladies and gentlemen, and we must understand that these studies will probably take a further five years to complete.
Subsidiarity works in favour of Community action in this specific context.
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.
I believe that you have achieved the main objective of the European Central Bank: to maintain price stability.

Furthermore, the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation.



I am particularly pleased that this report includes support in the language or dialect of the victim of crime because sometimes that is an area that is overlooked.
You must read the report, as I have done.
We also need to enhance Community aid management by improving the planning and implementation of Community instruments, taking account of the finding made by the Commission and endorsed by the Member States, that there is an unacceptable divide between commitments and Community appropriations disbursed and the increasing criticism, legitimate criticism, by third countries of slow, unwieldy processes.


The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.
I therefore nurture the hope that tomorrow in plenary sitting, this report will be adopted in the form we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights drafted it in.
There are also a few other issues which have struck me.
I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union' s work on hold for a short while.
It is the first budget for which the new Commission has drawn up a preliminary draft budget and the first budget in which I, as a new Commissioner, shall be involved right from the outset.
Nevertheless, Parliament believes that the integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will mean that, as well as stability, there will be sufficient flexibility to allow for a review of those perspectives when necessary.
We voted on this report in committee, a committee on which all groups are represented.

May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.

Mr President, the back-peddling in relation to the adoption of the EURODAC system has given rise to numerous, logical questions concerning both the expediency and the efficiency of the system for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum which complements the Dublin Convention.

Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.



Mrs Darras, I do not believe that we shall need to renegotiate the Financial Perspective in the matter of cohesion policy.


That is in nobody' s interest.
By producing moderate and well-considered solutions, not only will we be able to overcome problems such as xenophobia; we will also be able to tackle the problems associated with having a disproportionate number of elderly people in the European Union.
Like my colleague, Mrs Lambert, I am concerned that this compromise has not gone quite far enough in relation to doctors' hours.


We have neither a joint evaluation of demographic trends, nor do we know what impact this legislative initiative will have on the individual Member States.

There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.

We will listen to the debate because our overwhelming desire is to get the bones of this proposal through.






Quite clearly, over and above natural political differences political dialogue must exist, a political dialogue between people and organisations that respect and defend the values of democracy and freedom.
Mr President, there were two monsters in Ancient Greek mythology which killed and swallowed people, Scylla and Charybdis.

In fact, the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for US and British pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military-industrial complexes in both the US and Britain.
The countries of the south, more than any other part of Europe, urgently need a policy for the protection of forests.
I believe that we in the European Union have a more important role to play there than we have previously done and that our policy cannot stop at support for the KEDO programme.
It is indefensible to deliberately - I repeat, deliberately - create life in order to use it as research material.
I believe that the journey on which we embarked at Helsinki will be a long one and that no one is yet able to predict where it will end, except in Turkey' s assuming an important position either inside or outside of the European Union.

What we have noticed is that sometimes the policy is ad-hoc or belated and, in a sense, Lisbon, with its "dotcom approach" , is a good example of this.
Mr President, on the present issue I represent a minority of the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
We will not have a developed market unless we have investment.



Can anyone assist with installing a Sonicwall Long Range Wireless card?


I think that, with a little good will, this should be feasible.
This morning nobody protested against this.

The representatives of these have, on repeated occasions, expressed the view that Europe has "fallen behind" the GMO industry in, above all, the United States and China, that the GMO industry cannot be "developed" as "freely" in Europe and that opportunities for new jobs and businesses "are being lost" in the EU' s fifteen Member States.
The only reason we are not voting against this text is that we refuse to be associated with the extreme right and their despicable ranting.

We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.

The postal service is also the social service.



Unfortunately, the report does not address these issues.
It is an enormously important part of Europe's endeavours over the next few years; as important, in some ways in projecting stability, as the whole process of enlargement.


Nothing, apparently, since in France, for example, the administration' s skimming off half the national wealth does not enable it to ensure the safety of the people, to achieve general welfare, to preserve their quality of life or to provide a consistent and effective transport policy.

This Parliament has noticed this and offered its support, and I urge the Commission to take this message extremely seriously and to grant this aid.

In short, the Group of the Party of European Socialists endorses the conclusions of our President, whom we congratulate on her fair and courageous statements.


At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.

As you know, we in the PPE are calling for this in all areas needed to complete the single market, wherever healthy competition can replace hand-me-down monopolies.



Just let me quote to the Commissioner, and to the Commission, the saying of Oscar Wilde that in our dealings with life, destiny never closes her book.
There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight.
First of all, it replaced the principle of collegiality in Union decisions with a greater emphasis on bilateral action between Governments.

Not only is there incineration but there is now a sodium hydrolysis method of dissolving cattle.

How do we explain the different prices for BSE tests in Europe?


It would make it possible to raise the profile of sites which are of more than purely national importance but which are not yet accorded world recognition.



No, preparations need to be made now.
And this is something upon which we agree.
I cannot think of anything worse than languishing for 25 years among the sand dunes and being taken in by referenda year upon year, only then to starve to death.
paulproteus, i used synapt to get bittorent and installed it... how do i know where it is installed and how do i run it>



The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.

In this spirit, we are urging that special publicity be given to all complaints in order that any action taken is made more obvious.
The police are doing everything possible, but nothing like the promised number of police has arrived.
Regardless of how matters stand or what the final version of the report will be, and whatever the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament, it is bound to be an improvement on the previous situation.
Madam President, Commission, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister here.

Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bouwman on the publication of this text, which had been uncertain for a long time.





This directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable.
Firstly, to enhance and underscore the independence of the European Central Bank.

There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq.
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.


I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.

I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.
We have to make the reporting and monitoring process more effective, which will require not only good will but also adequate resources and diplomatic willingness.
We must make certain that the regulations being prepared, which have been submitted to this Parliament, adopt this approach.
Both consumers and small specialist chocolate-makers would suffer a reduction in quality and standards would be reduced to the lowest level.


The Court of Auditor' s observations with regard to shortcomings in the exercise of control are currently being given consideration under the clearance of accounts procedure.
Those who vote in favour of the draft agreement do not know how many committees and committee meetings they are approving.

People are sensitised today and have fears of a high level of air pollution and the illnesses which can result and so the policy must also create completely clear framework conditions to limit the risk.
It was, of course, a mistake, which has caused problems for the Commission and for all of us as the European Union, in the face of the legitimate hopes of the peoples of Eastern Europe who, after 50 years of Communist dictatorship, which we did nothing to combat, now, I believe, have the right to be part of the European Union.

It provides for environmental inspections of all industrial and other enterprises whose emissions and discharges on the environment are subject to particular authorisations or licensing requirements.
I hope very much that the authorities in Israel will end the economic and financial blockade of Palestinian areas because, in the short, the medium and the long term, this will increase instability and sustain the violence.
But the inclusion of "fallen cattle, sheep and goats" in the definition cannot be accepted.


I would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this. It is now up to the Commission.

The Union as a political entity has a moral and legal obligation to ensure that a clean environment is protected and promoted under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty.
I simply wanted to express my total disagreement with the previous President chairing this sitting with regard to speaking time, since he has not respected the time allocated to the Groups and the time which is, of course, distributed amongst the MEPs.
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.

The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.
|QuaD-: a comment like that is not a conversation stopper.





As happened last year, there was a very heated discussion on how much aid should be made available for the Balkans, and I would remind you that during the discussions on Budget 2000, the Council took the line that it would not be possible to release the appropriations for Kosovo in any case.

But I am acutely aware that by punishing Greece for achieving something positive, we will let the actual guilty party off the hook.


We must consider whether it is reasonable to give animals feed supplements which cause abnormal growth.
The fact is that the basic points made by the Committee on Petitions have already been included in the text of the report I drew up.

If, at the end of these negotiations, the parties to the OSPAR Convention were to adopt a decision which, in the Commission' s opinion, should be incorporated within Community law, the Commission would be responsible for preparing a proposal for a decision by the Council on the adoption by the Community of this OSPAR decision.

This is a political point, it is a political statement, and we have drawn the relevant conclusions here bilaterally speaking, and bilaterally speaking no one can deny us the right to draw conclusions as regards our relations with Austria.

Thank you, Mr President, for all your kind support over the years for the Budgetary Control Committee.
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.



We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.

We also consider that the application of directives is the responsibility of the law, the Commission and the Court of Justice.
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.

Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.


What I want to say is that all those who support the idea of a European monitoring centre agree on its mission and its form.
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.
Their aim is not so much to defend and promote human rights as to make a clean sweep of all the points of reference on which our societies are founded and replace them with an individualist jumble 'with neither lord nor master' .


I feel that in holding a topical and urgent debate on this matter we would be acting upon our discussion earlier this morning, which you agreed to champion, Madam President. We are all here and there is nothing to stop us, and in this way we will show all those countries against whom we often have to deliver opinions that we will not hold back on matters requiring thorough investigation such as discrimination against the disabled or where journalists are prevented from doing their job, and that we will not hesitate to investigate these incidents even when they occur within our Community.




I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber for their reports, which are doubtless comprehensive and very detailed in terms of all the guidelines.

Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.

She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers.
This amendment has not been taken up, and we regret the line followed by the European Commission, with the participation of the Member States, because it leaves aside, at risk of marginalising it, a form of participation which is particularly important in this field.
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.
That is why one of our proposals is to create a budget line for 2001 to cover these needs.
But is this difficult field, with all the hopes and fears it brings, being handled in a manner that is beyond reproach?
This fee would help finance 90% of the cost of these facilities.


They have also found a transport vessel, flagged in Panama and owned in Japan, both contracting parties to ICAT by the way, which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize.
You quite rightly also pointed out, and I think that is quite clear, that we need rules on duty time, and I myself am surprised that in spite of this long process the social partners have still not managed to put rules together.

The corruption of society eventually harms economic development.
The Commission is actively participating in the deliberations of the Council aimed at assessing and ensuring a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries as a key requirement for accession to the European Union.

Furthermore, it is clear that there is still no reliable method for testing the quantity of such fats used in chocolate production, whilst there is no requirement for clear, compulsory labelling which would, as a minimum, allow consumers to distinguish real chocolate, which only uses cocoa butter, from chocolate whose ingredients include other fats.
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.
Fourthly, controls and assessments are the alpha and omega of any structural policy that has the noble objective of making itself superfluous as quickly as possible.

In this respect, we should learn from the United States, which is the country which affords the greatest protection for this freedom.
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.

London leads the way in the EU tax battle' , 'Swiss banks see no need for action' , 'all financial centres must cooperate to do away with banking secrecy' .

We are, in fact, facing an historic watershed, an unprecedented opportunity, because the present climate, this combination of circumstances, is exceptional.

There is no need for me to stress the importance of this joint visit. The fact that I am stressing it should show you, as you might imagine, that I should like to see the Chamber as well attended as possible.



I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.

The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation.
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.

The way to compile accident statistics therefore includes recording, processing and interpreting accident data.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.


It also has something to say on methodology - how, in other words, to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights Mr Gama mentioned is a political challenge for all of us.



I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.




We have a vast European heritage of culture and communications which must be fully exploited, and for this more funding will certainly be necessary, but this purpose could also be served by opportunities for discussion, such as the Forum proposed by the rapporteur: this would be an opportunity for discussion aimed at the creation of a future audiovisual policy which would take advantage of the infinite number of openings provided by the newest technology and use them to further progress towards the goal of producing increasingly high quality products.
It is no secret that I am very much in favour of a permanent link between Denmark and Germany, and I am glad that the new Danish Minister for Transport is also a supporter of the project.




We therefore feel that the Commission' s proposal to amend Regulation No 723/97 and to change the legal basis of the Regulation on preventing fraud and other irregularities from Article 37 to Article 280 of the Treaty, as the rapporteur Mr Casaca proposes, is extremely timely.

However, I believe that it would be a big mistake for the European Parliament to approve of this sort of trend.

Adequate protection must be guaranteed for crime victims within our Union and it is essential that equal treatment for these victims is also guaranteed, whether in court or before the authorities. Active means of support must also be developed.
I am concerned because I would not like the State budgets and pension agencies to try to hold back this research, which would have negative implications for them because of the greater expenditure they would incur.

The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.



Mr President, Mr Arvidsson, I fully appreciate the work which you have done on this report.
Mr President, after congratulating our colleagues Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea on their reports and the suggestions they contain, of which I very largely approve, I shall make do with two observations.

I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.
The compromise reached on heavy metals is also a giant step towards an environmentally friendly strategy for dealing with the flow of materials.

We would like to point out that we should promote the liberalisation of the economic systems of our Mediterranean partners and carry out the structural changes necessary to compete in more open markets.

I must make it clear that the Commission has simply said that it would use available funds and that savings would be made in the common agricultural policy.


This is why Europe as a whole, not just Mediterranean Europe, to which, as an Italian, I have the honour to belong, must now recognise its strategy on the East and on the South and its commitment to these regions as absolutely essential, and confirm that if healthy, lasting progress is to be achieved, the requirements of the economy must go hand in hand with human dignity.

it's even on the agenda :)


However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.

The Council as such is not, by definition, a member of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Our group supports the committee' s amendments.




In July 1999, the Commission presented a communication entitled 'A Concerted Strategy for Modernising Social Protection' .

I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.

We have just seen the first vote after the formal sitting fail to secure a qualified majority by only a handful of votes.

OK, it's a quarter to 2am, time to go
and crashes :D
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.


It is particularly depressing to see that, in a number of Central and Eastern European countries, children are suffering from the consequences or, to be more precise, the uncontrolled consequences of social change.
Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, the volume of world trade has soared in recent decades.
First the heads of state and government confirmed that Greece meets the necessary conditions to enter the third phase of economic and monetary union.

That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.
Mr President, I was unable to assent to the Ferber report.

It should, however, be pointed out that the experience from the studies which Cirea has carried out shows that women who are subjected to violence, rape or mutilation do not always give these reasons as the main grounds for their asylum application.
Firstly, with regard to regional cooperation - and the presidency has just answered this in part - the Union bases its Mediterranean policy on the Barcelona Process.



We still have a whole series of problems to solve.

We experienced this at first hand because our group came under fire.

Can the Council really back out of its responsibility in the individual Member States so easily?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have absolutely no doubt that we shall all be true to those guiding principles I referred to: responsibility, transparency and honesty.
Despite this, it is a problem report in a way, not because it is causing something to be done, but because the sector we are dealing with is extremely diverse.

The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour.

The Commission shares the concern for action, and not just words, in ensuring the coherence of the rules on human rights applied by the national courts and by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or the Court of Justice of the European Communities.


We need a general system of accreditation for private, public and in-house education, a European education passport like a European driving licence so that the building blocks of education can be used and compared throughout Europe.
With the permission of the House, I will address points arising from both reports in this context rather than dealing with each report separately.

I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.


We must now accept in our hearts what our heads have known and been dictating for a long time.


This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
How can I make my serial mouse work?


Council and Commission Statements - Preparation of the European Council (Santa Maria da Feira, 19-20 June 2000), including the situation in the Middle East
As Mr MacCormick says, we have to get people across the Union together talking region to region, university to university.
Clearly we must move as quickly as possible to close the legal loophole constituted by the flawed European patent.

So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.
There is a challenge for Parliament in playing its part in helping Europe to become the dynamic centre of sustainable job creation, innovation, competitiveness and modernised social welfare.

Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.
The conservation of our cultural heritage is associated not only with a high level of responsibility, but also with high levels of cost.

Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.
In that way, the EU would reinforce the existing conventions, and that is something there is a need for.



These are still needed in order to fully finance the initiative announced at the G7 Summit in Cologne.

For decades, rail services have been withdrawn in all parts of Europe for the benefit of the private road-haulage and bus companies.

The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.


The European edifice will not be built simply by the addition of those who make it up; it will be the result of a concordance of views about its destiny and the ways to achieve it, or it will not be built at all.

It is unlikely that a scoreboard will be able to unlock this paralysis within policy.


As far as the past pollution of land is concerned, the proximity principle ought to be applied, because national, regional or local authorities are in the best position to deal with these issues.
I do not know of a single other area - the euro, the free movement of persons, goods or capital - where a timescale of this order is tolerated.
We invite the Commission to come back before the end of the year to report on the developments in Fiji and the region as a whole and on the efforts which the European Union has made.
We want to build on Europe's lead on mobile telephony and adopt the examples of such great global players as Finland's Nokia.


I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level.



That is the reason for the delay in presentation.
In accordance with this decision, and let me quote once again, "The General Secretariat of the Council shall make accessible to the public a list of the items on the provisional agendas of meetings of the Council and its preparatory bodies referring to cases where the Council acts in its legislative capacity" .

Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on hushkitted aircraft (B5-0018/2000);

They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.
The position of these doctors in training is similar in many countries: working weeks of 70 and 80 hours in conditions that are occasionally disgraceful and sometimes dangerous to patients.
The share of rail transport, measured in tons per kilometre, has fallen to below 15%, but even this way of measuring the figures gives too rosy a picture of the situation.
This complexity is such as to discourage SMEs, which, as we all know, are bending under the weight of bureaucracy.

Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.
We have therefore tabled a number of amendments which we hope Parliament can accept.





Secondly: we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce.


The idea behind this decision is that therapeutic cloning, that is, the cloning of embryonic cells that are undifferentiated from human embryos available for research and production is a promising way forward.

In short, I would say if such an instrument is ever to be invented and devised, it should be done with bankers and industrialists, people who know what they are talking about, not bureaucrats sitting in the European Commission.
The central tenet of the Franco-German dialogue is clear: we need a two-speed Europe.
My last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas.

There was some confusion in relation to Great Britain in the report.


Commissioner, thank you for your answer, which I find partially satisfactory as I am well aware of your personal interest in the matter and of the initiatives you have undertaken to combat prostitution rings.
It is not enough just to send cheques. We cannot accept any form of renationalisation of cohesion policy for we still have shared priorities, genuine Community priorities and it is in our shared interest to ensure the sustainable and balanced development of a frame of reference for cohesion policy.

Nothing could be further from the truth!

The technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists.
On the one hand, there are the fixed-price systems which have launched the renewable energy industry in Europe.

It is absolutely essential that we rewrite the rules but we cannot ask working people to pay a price - which amounts to bankruptcy in many European countries - which is not theirs to pay.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.

We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.

Lastly, when enlargement takes place the Union will become bigger, obviously, and the Community patent will then apply to the countries that have acceded to the European Union.





I think it is right to take a stand against the decision taken by the British Parliament.
Next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.
Ethiopia and Eritrea bear the ultimate responsibility.



At last, it is again possible to discuss all issues openly and critically.
I ask Parliament, Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem.



Other amendments which improve the directive concern greater transparency and openness to inspection and the need also to cooperate and consult with countries outside the Community.

We are not asking it to deal with such problems, we are simply asking that it should analyse them.
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.

Finally, may I also express my sympathy for the families of the victims and recognise before this Chamber the extreme sense of duty shown by those two officers in that tragic event which took place on 24 February.


Finally, I gather that it is proposed that software might be patented.

linux_mafia, yes
I believe that this is a factor of importance.
Secondly, having identified all these infringements, do you intend to refer this to the Court which, unfortunately for my country - gave us a recent example by finding Greece guilty of another, older infringement?
I believe that we have, in this new draft regulation, a solid basis for a political and economic debate with the industrialised states.
It would perhaps be a good idea if other Member States were to have something similar.
Alas, there are not many occasions when people cheer the European Union in the streets - all too few occasions in the country I know best.

I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.

We must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day (it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure).
On Tuesday, i.e. tomorrow, we shall be voting on the Goodwill report, to which I have proposed a number of amendments.
Its goal must be the all-round development of young people as individuals.


The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.

We are still awaiting this report.

While the service providers benefit from the largest part of the commercial margin and are free to choose the most profitable sectors, the rail companies on the other hand are left to bear the high equipment and personnel costs.



In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU, the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars, of course, of this report, and coherence and consistency are therefore attained.
I would like to draw attention to this situation, and I believe that we must rethink our attitude towards education, as we are talking about people and our future.

Are we ready to pay for those resources?

The points which were missing from the Commission proposal and which were added by Mr Valdivielso de Cué are important ones.
Far-reaching changes will not be achieved over night.
And we hope that if it becomes apparent that ships are continuing to discharge waste into the sea, the Commission will propose an amendment at the revision stage in three years' time.
I will take that as an interesting intervention.
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.

(B5­0383/2000) by Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Sörensen and Mr Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on prisoners in Iran charged with spying for Israel and the United States.

Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.




Thoughts of a modern slave trade with fatal consequences for those involved spring clearly and inevitably to mind.
For a long time we have felt a review of the membership of the Security Council to be necessary, but we consider that it would be more appropriate for representation to the Council to be by major continents, such as Africa, South America and Europe.
Especially as, even though we have the most stringent fair trading legislation, the real world in which we live is a world in which large monopolies abuse dominant market positions, in which mergers, take-overs and acquisitions by corporate behemoths are a daily occurrence, giving rise to monopolies of global proportions which almost always lay off thousands of workers and have a huge impact on employment and which then monopolise wealth-producing resources, markets and consumers.


Mr President, the report you have presented is ambitious and complex, and I will only touch on a few points.
Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms.
One of the demands being made is for taxation on currency transactions, a so-called Tobin tax.
May I ask him to confirm that the Commission's choice not to participate in certain meetings will be taken, as he put it, on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, not a structure by structure basis, depending on what is being discussed.
It is true that extending qualified majority voting to European Union sectors of activity which currently require unanimous votes is indeed one of the major issues of the Intergovernmental Conference currently taking place.
In Lisbon, we will find the fruit of our preparations, on which we have worked together, with the cooperation, for which I am extremely grateful, of the Portuguese Presidency. We will find specific, operational undertakings, clear objectives and a limited number of tangible, but assessable measures which will enable us to speed up change and make progress, because leadership in the next century is being decided now.
Incidentally, it is our view that this European Union strategy should start from the premise that the armed conflict that is affecting Colombia is by no means confined to the drugs problem alone.
Aha.

Perhaps they would come to understand better.


B5­0003/2001 by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on the plan to build peace and prosperity and strengthen the State, known as 'Plan Colombia' .

Mr Gorostiaga, in the name of this freedom of expression that you cite, can you look me in the eyes and assure me that neither myself nor my family are under threat from ETA for using this freedom of expression here in Parliament?
We must never forget that the United Nations exists but that, within that framework, there is room for a European initiative, and my opinion is that, at the moment, there is room for a European initiative in the Western Sahara issue and that we could put an end to this last colonial battle.
In that case, competition is distorted, to the disadvantage both of consumers and of private companies.
For the first time the four or five most important parameters have now been defined, and both sides have accepted them as the important parameters to be defined and accepted, and they have begun to negotiate them seriously and in depth.
The mislaying of the report relating to the Commission meeting, during which the penalty in the Flèchard case was decimated, is nothing short of a mockery.
But whether it will be adopted at this stage remains to be seen.
In view of the fact that we cannot possible reorganise our debate on the basis of procedural motions, I would ask you to please tell me immediately, Mr Alavanos, in accordance with the terms of the Rules of Procedure, to which Rule your procedural motion refers.
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have visited Turkey three times in the last six months, once before and twice after the Helsinki resolution.
We did not, at this stage, wish to carry out assessments or budget estimates.
The point being that we MEPs have the opportunity, once a month, to submit a written question, for priority consideration which, according to the Rules of Procedure, must be responded to within three weeks.


CheatersRealm: synaptic?


It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks.

This last aspect is, in fact, an unambiguous indication of commitment and political determination.
Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency.


There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.

I would ask the representative of the Council whether he thinks the President of the Commission' s action was right and justified, and whether the Council also wants to restrict the Ombudsman' s freedom of speech on this topic.
The quality of life - and sleep - of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard.


Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, indeed, I checked the situation: it was only this morning that we received the request for split voting, which was therefore not within the time limits set by our own rules.
Non-lawful immigration or the trafficking in human beings is a new form of slavery that cannot be tolerated in our democratic societies.
Instead of being controlled, restructuring, mergers and company relocations leading to tens of thousands of job losses are being made even easier.
But I am extremely grateful to President Prodi for the fact that he deemed the occurrence so important as to address us in person today.

Such a separation must be effected as quickly as possible, as it is a prerequisite for different transport firms being able to compete with each other on the same terms as apply within other forms of transport.
The rapporteur complains that the objectives are more the result of higher than expected tax revenues and the favourable development of interest rates than of the Member States' own efforts.
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.

I would like to see whether there are differences in the pattern of the school day, whether this varies in different parts of Europe, and whether this offers ways of improving education.


It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.



In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.


However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.
Only now are the Commission and Council trying to outline common policies for certain economic problems such as unemployment and competitiveness.
It has become clear that the European Union cannot only not remain indifferent to the current situation in that country, in the same way that it cannot - or rather must not - adopt half-hearted positions on this issue.
The fact that the Bulgarian government signed this text without questioning this, has a certain political significance.



Greater transparency is also our primary concern with regard to the finances of political groups within this House; the citizens of Europe, moreover, would not understand if we said otherwise.


This was totally obvious from my intervention in this House when this issue was first debated.

I am not in favour of setting lower limits for certain categories of young road-users though.
In fact, as far as this draft budget is concerned, the Council is the outright winner and legitimately so; not by scoring a victory against us, rather it is a winner all round.
However, Mr President, over and above these deep-rooted differences lie the most deeply-rooted common principles which ultimately boil down to something as simple as the need for trust between Member States.

A systematic examination of what happens on the roads can provide important data to help ensure greater safety and prevent accidents.

France had simply forgotten that it no longer had the right to do this.
If the opposition has no opportunity to express its opinion, if a public debate about society is no longer possible, then you are looking at total dictatorship. And I know just how painful that is from personal experience.
The Swedish Government and a large percentage of the Swedish people want the derogation to be extended on public health grounds.


Essentially, the number of plastic objects which could be put in the mouth and swallowed is increasing.

Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?
Does it consider that the measures it is taking are sufficient to guarantee the safety and dignity of women in Europe in the face of the threat of trafficking?
Quite the opposite. I do not know of a single example of a country which made any progress by applying their directives.
Rewop: but if you want to help to track bugs and dont care about the instabilities (and know how to fix certain things) hoary is for you



I am faced with a situation where if I do not do this I would be acting in a manner which would in all probability be strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and by this House.
(SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.
This is why the Council and the Member States must work for the universal ratification of the main human rights instruments available to all countries, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, already mentioned, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the extremely important Convention against Torture.

But if I have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term, it would be, to be candid, our policy in and around the Mediterranean.
Nevertheless, I must point out that, although in our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, there is, understandably, no single point of view on this issue, the majority of us are in favour of this rapid reaction force.

I think it is important for us to analyse what these differences, in the guise of policy, in fact look like when it comes to problems such as drug abuse by young people.
Allow me to start with the most important demand.
At any rate, the Commission intends to keep Parliament and the competent committees informed of the agendas more quickly and more effectively, so that these agendas can be better harmonised and we can speed up the drafting of the required legislation.







I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.
2005-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	mike998	cheers, anyway
Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them.
In order to escape, we can only invite the governments to exercise the utmost caution, retain as much power as possible, and interpret Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam narrowly.

So I refer to the things I do not agree with.
An alternative approach to the Intergovernmental Conference, which this Parliament has repeatedly advocated, was not even mentioned.
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.



However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.

In fact between1992 and 1992 the LIFE initiative cofinanced nearly 1600 projects with a total Community contribution of approximately EUR 2.1 billion.
Together with the Council, we have done everything within our power.
Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not, in my view, properly understood.

It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.

What has become permanent for one person is tending to become permanent for that person' s family and friends.

Nigeria can once again serve as an example here, as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage.
Commissioner, this is a matter for you.

Madam President, I disagree with this decision.

While it is necessary to learn more quickly from good practices, it is also necessary to create suitable new practices and be innovative in the field of political methodology.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society.
More than 1 300 new companies have been set up, generating 42 000 jobs, and investment flows to the tune of EUR 3 500 million have been created.
Unfortunately, only 2% of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, I think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough.

However, I fail to understand the reference to the oceans.
daf: why?
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.


We have made requests and have largely reached cross-party agreement in Parliament that something should be done.



I have one small correction to make, unless I misunderstood, to what Mrs Smet has just said. It is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the European Parliament and the Council.


It was not by chance that a party that received a larger number of votes was invited to form the government, but that it then passed on to the party with the third largest number of votes.


The recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers.

This was the guidance given by the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997.
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.



Mr President, the evidence coming from Bosnia in particular points clearly to a massive increase in cases of cancer where bombings took place during the Balkans war and where ammunition rounds of depleted uranium were used.

Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.



I cannot help thinking that the boundaries are forever being extended.


In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft, with a view to reducing its influence on noise pollution.

yea, finding people to do work for money ...
I can fully identify with Mr Bouwman' s amendments on this point, as I could with his contribution.

And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.

Understand this. I and my colleagues on the European right will vote for the 'zero option' which is no vegetable fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate.
This has proved ineffective in practice.
/192.168.1.3/Donkey
It is quite unacceptable for MEPs to have to spend time which should be devoted to political work or to their electorate at home on wondering how they will manage to get to their place of work and also on working out where they are going to spend the night.

Finally, with regard to the paper industry: it should clean up its bad former record on the pollution of the environment, and it is also important to inquire into the difficulties of monopolies in the paper sector, particularly with regard to cartels in the recycling sector.
daf: random O:-)
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.



If that had been the case, some Members might have voted differently.
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.



Maybe this is due to the fact that the PPE-DE group is not one group, that the British Conservatives are allowed to run their own shop and that they keep their own accounts.

Report (A5-0028/2000) by Mr Decourrière, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States laying down guidelines for a Community Initiative concerning trans-European cooperation intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the European territory (INTERREG) [COM(1999) 479 - C5-0243/1999 - 1999/2178 (COS)]

Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port.



Obviously, we have to push back the tide of fraud and the money which has been lost because of fraud needs, of course, to be traced. But the overall budget for this important, environmentally-friendly crop needs to be increased, and that is why the quotas which are now being laid down are inappropriate.
The circumstances surrounding the rapporteur' s explanation can be called embarrassing and harm the committee' s reputation.
Additionally, the rapporteur does not do justice to the principle of subsidiarity when he asks for Community action in the field of education, technology and resources for the Commission.



A list of what are called 'priority' substances will be submitted to the European Parliament in the near future.
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.
There is a significant diversity of religions and traditions in all of those countries and this is one of the pillars on which the European Union' s work is based.

Mr President, Commissioner Monti, on the subject of the proposal before us, I should like to make four remarks or observations on behalf of my Group, but not without first congratulating our fellow Member, Mrs Randzio-Plath.

Their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer.

The Member States may impose restrictions on the right to free movement of Community citizens, particularly in matters of entry to and expulsion from their territory as well as the issuing or renewal of residence permits, where this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
I hope Maastricht taught you otherwise.
This correlation between noise and rolling, tyre grip and fuel consumption is rightly at the centre of the concern expressed in Amendment No 1.

Instead of expecting Central Bank policy or taxation policy to resolve some of the problems of the European economy, European policy should resolve the issues it is able to, such as the issue of restructuring and flexibility in the economy and in the labour market, immediately.


Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence.


The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.
I really do not know how you square the circle, but by the end of 2002 we must.

Many pensioners, with whom I often discuss matters in Italy, say to me "Mr Fatuzzo, I have had a serious car accident.

It is clear that the de facto veto, currently inherent in this procedure, must go.
This is why we support the amendments that have been tabled, and we trust that we shall nevertheless be able to avoid a conciliation procedure.

Finally, I would like to turn your attention to the need to improve levels of gender equality in sport and exercise.

Instead of increasing the funding by 1%, in line with inflation, and reaching the amount of EUR 885.5 million, as is also suggested by our rapporteur, we will be proposing a 10% reduction.
This is not just verbal support, but also tangible support in the form of new transmission equipment being provided to the affected stations, following consultation, as stipulated in paragraph 3 of the present joint resolution.

Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.



Gene transfer between organisms is, as we know, a common phenomenon in nature.
This smacks of the unpleasant tones of revolutionary propagandists of every age, seeing reactionary plots between the cloth and the women in every household rejecting the bright revolutionary future.
This directive authorises the use of a number of new food additives which are currently banned but which have been assessed recently by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and deemed fit for human consumption.

I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.

This makes stale carrots look fresh. What consumer interest is served by doing this?

The United Kingdom has been affected badly.




In my view, the proposed extension to the concept of interoperability, by including questions such as the professional qualifications of staff and the need for health and safety regulations at the workplace, is of paramount importance and a vote in favour of the report by my group depends on it.
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	i already tried to give it a static ip
I also believe, however, that we ought to set an example at European level.


Anyone here install and running Drupal?

That is obviously a shock, not in terms of our technical knowledge of encryption, but in terms of our political beliefs.

However, as proposed by the rapporteur, the amendments approved at first reading but not accepted by the Council must now be included.
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.

Commissioner, with regard to the forestry issue, I would like to say that, although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept, you have, at least, been frank, in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents, which may have been rather rash.
Let me assure you that all your comments will be passed on to the Bureau.

We can always wish for a more active Europe.


Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to request that the vote on Maaten report be postponed until July.
The desire to raise moral standards regarding aid policy and increase the efficacy of the use of aid is a principle which is now clearly defined and our group is pleased with that.

I want to make it clear that the Commission shares the view of the UN Special Rapporteur who states in his report to the Commission on Human Rights that: "Tunisia still has a long way to go to take full advantage of its favourable economic context and adopt measures designed to strengthen the protection of human rights and, in particular, the right to freedom of opinion and expression".

Unfortunately, humanitarian aid cannot play this role and must not serve only to bail out a liberal policy which at the same time murders the populations of the countries in receipt of aid.
We take the view that liberalisation should apply first and foremost to freight traffic, both transnational and, in the end, national freight traffic.
Mr Prodi, for example, stressed the need to restore peace throughout the country during his visit to Algiers on 12 and 13 January.


Let us hope that Parliament' s subdued criticism gets through to the relevant parties. This includes the Belgian government, which has already made so many pledges that even the press is starting to question the viability of this spending impulse.

Regarding junior doctors, I would refer to what Mr Provan said, because he explained quite clearly what we eventually achieved.
Companies have to spend nine months on the preparation of an environmental report.

Mrs Paulsen, was right: this is exactly where compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is needed.

On 29 April 1999, the European Union adopted a Council regulation with a view to controlling and reducing the noise produced by subsonic aircraft engines, limiting in due course the use of silencers, which do not resolve the problem completely, and helping airlines to update their fleets with new generation aircraft which create less pollution.
Mr President, we are discussing the European Parliament report on the information strategy to be adopted in the final phase of application of monetary union.
I would recommend that we support this programme.

Secondly, the budget has not yet reached the prescribed ceiling. I hope that the Council will make up the difference, if not, Parliament will be submitting proposals.
I think it is important for health reasons.
It fundamentally violates all the international conventions protecting human rights.

Is it not time - the question is obviously mainly directed at Russia, but it is for us to consider also - that we embarked on measures that would persuade people to invest in Russian oil production?
Thirdly: the Fifth Framework Programme on research contains a great deal of socio-economic research, the purpose of which is to analyse what holds Europe together in the area of I+C technologies. We cannot fill and heat our locomotive with ordinary fuel and, at the same time, carry out socio-economic flanking research under the framework programme which makes no reference to this communication.
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.




That is why I want to tell Commissioners Fischler and Lamy, in all seriousness, that, while I understand their legitimate desire to put an end to this dispute, they cannot do it at the expense of the poorest citizens in the European Union.

There are most certainly a number of countries which are better off, which boast sound growth figures and where the first signs of prosperity are visible, but there are also countries where the situation has dramatically changed for the worse.

I therefore broadly support this programme.
We had a problem with two Leeds fans being murdered in a UEFA Cup game in Istanbul against Galatasaray, yet no action was taken against Galatasaray - they were not thrown out of the UEFA Cup.
By launching an extensive campaign, spearheaded by Greenpeace, it was possible to convince many policy-makers and politicians of the need to institute an immediate ban.


The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person's health.
Commissioner, as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I have to say that the report on cohesion is indeed an excellent basis for discussion and I trust that we shall be holding this discussion in the Committee on Regional Policy very soon and that it will be a very global discussion.
We must not therefore use the method of lowering taxes as a solution to this circumstantial rise in oil prices.
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.

We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.
But I am not one to blame you.
The Social Democratic Group will therefore do what it already decided to do weeks ago in the light of present knowledge. Bearing in mind the statements by both institutions, we shall make decisions next week on the following issues.


I highly recommend Ubuntu for everyone.
Mr President, my group welcomes this report.

We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.
The EU cannot, nor should it, spare any expense in the social and cultural spheres, in supporting democratic developments, in intervening in the event of human rights violations, in promoting economic development, and in improving dialogue and cooperation in as many areas as possible, if it wants to see discernible progress.
I ask this Parliament to be measured and considered in the way it deals with this important issue.
In drawing up its draft budget for the administrative expenditure covered by category 5 of the financial perspectives, the Council has been concerned to stabilise current expenditure, while taking account of the exceptional needs of the institutions, especially as regards staff for the Anti-fraud Office and the Court of Justice.


And so on and so forth.




There is really not very much this Parliament can do.
This also applies, and here I disagree with a number of previous speakers, to social comparability and alignment.

Given that the resultant product incorrectly referred to as chocolate will not be any cheaper, consumers will not gain in the purchase price what they will lose in transparency with regard to the nature of the product.

Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.


Firstly, it responds to a genuine problem caused by the abolition of internal borders within Europe. It therefore fills a legal void by establishing a system for the return of illegal immigrants based on the Schengen acquis and modelled on the Dublin Convention of 1990 on asylum seekers.

Mr President, this report refers to the fight against doping in sport.
The first rules that need to be complied with are those in the Treaty, in this case, Article 158, which takes the objective of economic and social cohesion to its highest level.
Madam President, we can all put our signatures to what is written in the resolution.
We want, in the final analysis, to place our trust in the courts, OLAF and the disciplinary measures and decisions taken and to work together with President Prodi' s new Commission on a basis of trust and on the basis precisely of the relevant new rules and obligations introduced.

This is a very important matter.
We should not buy a pig in a poke; we should vote on our report tomorrow and give these gentlemen the opportunity to think again.


Parliament should support this strategy, and we should, at the same time, insist that, before there can be any question at all about membership negotiations, the Copenhagen criteria should be met as these relate to democracy and human rights.

All children should have the right to a childhood!

I have a few comments to make on the Council' s first reading in this respect, which I have already submitted to the Committee on Budgets in the form of a discussion paper.
This is because the engines which the company concerned plans to use have a by-pass ratio of less than three and so would be excluded from EU airspace under the Regulation as it stands.
Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose.

The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances.

This too must be guaranteed and we must not let up in our pursuit of this objective.
That is the real problem and it is increasingly bringing us into disrepute.


I cannot however be delighted by it.
However, as Mr Rothley said, it was in response to an initiative from the European Parliament.
In this respect, there are two issues we should be discussing: in domestic terms, we must talk about the communication on air transport and the environment which Minister Coelho referred to, which we discussed yesterday in Council and which involves many other things, apart from simply noise, such as emissions, and a series of other issues. With regard to the United States, we must try to find a form of cooperation that goes much further than current cooperation within the ICAO.

In my opinion, there are three fundamental questions.
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.
The plan to involve them in the process of discussing and setting TSIs from the outset is important if the technical standards and specifications of future candidate countries to are to be brought into line early on with current developments in the EU.
I think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues.

In the light of this, our Group is not really opposed to permitting three additives in baking sprays, unlike the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I want to refer to the political position here.


Hey guys. I just did an install of Ubuntu last night. What's the easiest way to upgrade Firefox from 0.9.3 to 1.0?

This is not the kind of European Union which the people of Europe want; neither is it what the candidate countries want.

Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly, but, in the meantime, the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase the capacity of waste storage facilities, ensure that waste is processed or recycled, and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea.
And when I say 'Fourteen' I mean that it is not exactly a Council matter, rather a matter between the 14 Member States themselves.

In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.

Some think that the market is the invisible hand, the almost divine principle which should guide and control everything, while others think we should be very circumspect in liberalising the market and should only liberalise it where absolutely necessary.



No-one would benefit from this situation.
On health, the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health.
Parliament must investigate the misappropriation of funds by its political groups.
As for the European Parliament, Mr President, both the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development and its chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, have worked seriously and prudently on this difficult report.
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.









- At the outset, I would like to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur Mr Lehne on the way he had dealt with this difficult brief.
Mrs Carpena, relatives, friends and people from Malaga, as well as people from so many other places where the death toll has risen to more than a thousand, we feel for you and we should more than anything like to see an end to these acts of terrorism This is why we are opposed to polarisation.

All too often that is what has happened in the past.
We need to improve the availability of analysis and information exchange, and we need to radically enhance our capacities for pursuing preventive policies.

We would be entering a different society, one contrary to our values.
Mr President, unfortunately the action plans of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration hardly do justice to the task in hand.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.
i might know what you need though

It seems as if Latin America has suddenly disappeared from the map of the Commission' s concerns.
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.
Read Mr Katiforis' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.

We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.

A tiny piece of difficult-to-read information, hidden on the back of the product wrapper.


We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years.

We had the BSE crisis in Europe and several European countries suffered from swine fever outbreaks.

Since I am unable to support paragraph 6, I have therefore decided to abstain from voting on the whole text.

Like rail transport, the sea-fishing and off-shore sectors, as well as the activities of junior doctors, fall within the scope of the directive which we are discussing today.
Our feelings are as strong as our concern.
What we are doing here will be part of that change.


I must thank you, too, for outlining the possible avenues regarding the extremely sensitive matter of Jerusalem.
I wish to begin by thanking you for the excellent cooperation between your assistants and my services.
The financial scheme of setting aside 26 million for structural measures whilst keeping ten million in reserve for contingency measures could never lead to the goal which the Commission has in mind, namely an actual spreading of the financial responsibility.

We need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent, as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole.

We hope that we will be able to develop a better approach in the next part of this discharge procedure.

The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.
This regulation listed a number of technical requirements - JARs - produced by the Joint Aviation Authority.

2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	andy: dude, you're not copying what I wrote
As the importance of the role of the public broadcasting service in the digital system is recognised, the service will, of course, have to be reviewed and revamped in the light of changes in technology, but it will also have to perform the function of guaranteeing the quality of services to a large public, which will continue for a long time to use its common or garden television sets and wireless reception on a daily basis; therefore, strategic recognition of the role of land-based digital television, whose growth can only be considered to be an opportunity here as well.
I support the thrust of this report, which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour, because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour; secondly, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly, a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources.

This is something to which we also attach great importance.
Anyone who, at a time of mergers and rationalisation, wheels out the jobs argument to legitimise new technology needs above all to be clear about one thing: a just distribution of all the forms of work necessary to society can never be brought about by new technology alone.
We are dealing with an ever more hard-line dictatorship in Serbia.
I am determined to see that this Commission makes good its promises.
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.


Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.

When we advocate the need for political life in Austria to be in accordance with the values and principles promoted by the European Union, and which Austria has also undertaken to promote at European Union level, we are not trying to interfere in Member States' internal affairs.

Mr Della Vedova is afraid that the Community authorities will attempt to overburden the development of this sector, which is going to become so important for the European economy, with regulatory constraints.
There are quite a few different ideas and quite a few misconceptions, because if Mr García-Margallo y Marfil tells me that the European Parliament does not want to give up any of the powers it has only recently acquired, then I naturally share his view.

Before coming to the proposals contained in my report, it would be helpful to remind ourselves of some of the key issues in this debate.

Marble2, you get sound in everything else?
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.
I like to remember that, right here, in France, a couple of centuries ago, the first moves were made to define these rights, and only in North America, during the same period, were these rights actually given expression, apart from in the works of philosophers and academics, in legal documents such as the State Constitutions.
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.

The EU has offered both political and financial support to the peace initiative of President Pastrana of Colombia.
Where we do, too little of it is converted into market product and services.
I therefore support the following compromise: in the very short term we set up the 'picking up the pieces' line proposed by the Commission, and initiate the trialogue promptly in order, in the medium term, to achieve a vote for an self-contained budget line.


I am not so concerned about legal certainty as some people.
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.

Mr Commissioner, I am satisfied with your reply, but I would like to add something else. The sea is a difficult world, and the Community fleet which fishes in international Atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds.

Mr President, the Commission and Parliament will nevertheless have need of the Council in order to secure the requisite resources to create this European research area.

Mr President, while much progress remains to be made, it is true that the European Union has always pursued a policy of cooperation and development in respect of developing countries, and I believe that the environmental dimension must be incorporated into this policy and expanded upon.

I would very much agree with your observation that the European Union should adopt a long-term structural policy to tackle the causes of migration and I therefore agree that the deadlines set in the action plans are rather optimistic.

and takes up far more space and cpu

Still less credible are the conspiracy ideas cooked up by the ultra-nationalist grouping where the so-called traditional enemies, i.e. the national minorities in various candidate countries, are systematically associated with Jews.


This is vital for the poorest countries, especially if these enjoy good leadership and a balanced budget.

Consequently, any attempt to study this phenomenon must not be contained within the geographical borders of the Member States or even the candidate countries, but must be based on information from as many countries as possible, if it is to help prevent and combat the problem more efficiently.
I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights.
Mr President, like some of the previous speakers this evening, I am very pleased the Council came forward with this proposal.


As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.
This unfortunately echoes a decision taken yesterday by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg which gives the Church of Scientology the satisfaction of being treated like all European religions.

This is fine, but as rapporteur, I would like to add another dimension.

In my opinion, these are the genuinely important horizontal decisions adopted in Lisbon.
I am committed to the idea of providing a good education, as a way of preventing unemployment and social exclusion.
Some Member States have subjected the stability and convergence plans to internal debate in order to seek political support for this idea of jointly building economic unity, and we should ask the Member States who have not done so to debate these programmes in their parliaments in order to try, firstly, to persuade those states and parliaments to participate in this common task and, secondly, to provide political support for the commitments which are agreed to regarding the necessary coordination of economic policies.


It is vital for these accompanying institutional measures to be retained.
Forecast publication by the ECB should not be viewed as a panacea which will meet all the communication challenges faced by the ECB as a new institution in a testing multilingual and multinational environment.


I interpret the Commissioner' s statement here to the effect that there is now just such a coordinating working party as a step in that direction and, that being the case, I should just like to thank her for her answer.

A criticism was made of globalisation, which to me is absurd, for globalisation is already underway. The problem is rather how to accomplish it.




Motion for a resolution (B5-0766/2000) by Baroness Ludford on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the European Union' s position at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism

I would like to express my thanks too: it is a good basis for better standards of consumer safety throughout the European Union.
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.

These are the main reasons for my vote.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.
A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof.
you dont?
That is why Parliament must use its power to act.
She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing.

If women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty.
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.
Staffing levels are below those characteristic of other Commission departments and well below those in national administrations, which are known to invest considerably less in crisis prevention.
May they find comfort and strength in God, who can only truly gauge their sorrow and will gladly relieve their suffering.
Mr President, to continue along the line of reasoning followed during the work on this draft resolution in committee, I would like to table an oral amendment. It is for Parliament to decide: either we insert the words 'and left-wing' between the words 'right-wing' and 'extremism' , or we remove the word 'right-wing' altogether, and simply refer to 'extremism' .

We do have individual opinions within our Group.
er, the url that is
Mr President, I am delighted to be able to respond to the excellent report by Mr Newton Dunn, on the rapid reaction facility.
not everyone celebrates christmas

The Council has repeatedly urged the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to comply fully with its commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and cease to produce, test or export any missiles or missile technology.


I wish to make it absolutely clear here that the Kuhne report does not follow this theme.


This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.


This is why we have fought for such a long time for a directive which distributes this burden of proof, and all we men and women of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are asking for is for migrants to be treated in the same way as women.
The Commission observes that the British regulatory body appreciates the effort and commitment displayed by BNFL with respect to its concerns and also that significant progress has been made (I am quoting directly) regarding its other recommendations in the February report.

- (NL) Mr President, I would like to bring up another point.




You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.

Eek
The fundamental problem when we give mixed messages or perhaps poorly expressed or ill-judged messages is that we risk conveying the wrong message.

dagron: all gui tools require gksudo
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.


DoktorTomoe: /usr/local/Firefox/

However, when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report, when we look at the disparate views - the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce - we sometimes forget that a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves, who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I, "as an individual" or anybody else, as an individual consumer, would have.

Mr President, when it adopted the Radwan report, the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs missed a rare and valuable opportunity to draw attention to reasons for the weakness of the euro that cannot be laid at the door of the European Central Bank.
Let us proceed with the order of the day and put chocolate to its intended use, namely enjoyment.

A careful and generous stance is a welcome bonus in this respect.
It is a matter of how insurance companies calculate their premia, and if there are objective reasons for charging a higher premium for a particular region then the Commission is powerless.
The case of Mr Tapie was mentioned as a precedent to be followed in support of this decision.


There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.
We shall be supplementing our existing activities through the introduction of a dedicated programme using all the modern techniques at our disposal to ensure that the value of what we are doing is appreciated as widely as possible both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners.
We considered that 14 years old is an adequate solution.
What about energy policy, which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again?

This is in fact not the first time that a technological transition has changed the social model and the model of economic organisation.
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.
It imposes standards on beef in Britain and cheese in France and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct.


This is not covered by the directive.
In drawing up her second report, the rapporteur apparently did not take account of her fellow members' general lack of satisfaction.


These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.


This will should be shown through three essential aspects: firstly the defence of the major European causes of peace, freedom and economic and social development which must underlie the negotiations with the applicant countries; secondly the promotion of the merit of each country as the only condition to be imposed on accession, and thirdly the maintenance of the economic and social cohesion of the current 15 Member States.


Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.




For all these reasons I would like to call for the prompt transposition in all Member States of all the directives relating to radio-broadcasting and voice telephony, the interconnection and maintenance of digitisation, general authorisations and licences, leased lines, open networks, mobile telephones and data protection.
Parliament has been consulted, in the context of a political decision to be taken by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, after deliberation by the forthcoming European Council.
The European Union and its Member States in fact have some responsibility for the conservation of an ecosystem which is essential to the environmental balance of the entire planet.
(FR) We are discussing the two Council regulations establishing a form of systematic surveillance of forestry ecosystems which is unique in the world.
Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved.
it's around 20 here I think


We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.
ECHO also arranged this Monday for a mission to be sent to make an initial assessment of the needs as regards cooperation with other donors and the local authorities.
In this respect, I note that it is the two sides themselves who have come to see us, who are requesting our help, our advice, our intervention and our assistance, and not just and not predominantly financial assistance.
We have chosen the place where the European Court of Justice is located for the Community's tribunal on intellectual property.
There is a third problem: how are we going to pay for them?

I feel that is something else to think about - Mrs McNally' s report makes the same point - and then we would have a comprehensive energy efficiency programme in this sphere.
It also means that there can be no derogations.

The basis for meeting these new challenges has to be an efficient and transparent legislative framework.
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.

But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals.


This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.
Plan Colombia, drawn up between the United States and President Pastrana with no involvement by the Colombian Congress, is diametrically opposed to that principle.

Just as we condemn the trials against Kosovars held in custody in Serbia, we welcome the reopening of the proceedings in the case of Flora Brovina, which has previously been the subject of resolutions adopted by this House.

untested though :)


rhodan, do you see: "install theme" button?

It is becoming a subject of responsibility for the international community.


These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.
We feel that everything that can be possibly be done now and in the future, including in terms of equal opportunities, must be done and followed up: the Palestinian people has the right to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of the State of Israel.
Now, reading the preview of this part-session produced by Parliament' s press department, I note that the MEDIA Plus programme is not one of this week' s highlights.

2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	krischan	Hey, what application are available to play back MIDI files?

Be that as it may, Europe still has a great deal to do on the question of aviation.


great
The immediate reaction was to withdraw from Chechnya.

But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.
In addition, we need to lay down new legislation in this field as soon as possible.
This has been at a level of EUR 2.4 million; it could be a little more or a little less.
I feel that this is an over-cautious report, and yet it is already raising some people' s hackles.
We are, therefore, at an exploratory stage.
Unfortunately, the impact of the increase in road traffic density is not limited to pollution from end-of-life vehicles and their recycling, something that has not yet been resolved in spite of its worldwide nature, or to the damage and harm this does to the air we breathe, or even to the serious resultant global warming.
. (FR) I wish to express my support for establishing a new task, entrusted to a European Union agency, with a view to studying and more particularly to anticipating industrial change.
Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region, in the North-West of England, are eagerly awaiting this legislation.

In fact, the directive stipulates that the cost of treatment will be borne entirely by the producers.
This is a list of demands to which not only the European Commission but also the Council and all the Member States must pledge themselves if they want to prevent the depopulation, desolation and decline of rural areas in the European Union and the accompanying exacerbation of our social and cultural problems.

Furthermore, we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments.
That is my personal view, but I am sure that will be considered by Member States during the course of the next few months.
That is why they do not, under any circumstances, want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange.
Is this by any chance the Commission' s special contribution to the development of the new technologies?
Bangladesh has done quite a number of valuable things in recent years: regionally, agreeing more with her neighbours and approaching solutions to very old problems.
That is what this proposal for a rapid reaction mechanism is all about.
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.



Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough, responsible and unreserved report.





Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.
We must remember that the ratio between the per capita income of the European Union and the MEDA countries is 1 to 10, that is to say a very considerable gap.
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.
I am sure that Parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months.
Following their arrival in this country, third-country nationals cannot travel any further within the Schengen area until they have obtained what is called a residence permit.
This leads me, together with my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to refuse to endorse the Commission' s proposal to reduce the monthly increments for cereals in two phases, by 7.5% each time.



The report is accessible via the Internet, as is the Spanish Government' s response.
Well, the euro will have a great impact on them and it is they who deserve our special attention.
For example, the European Commission' s proposal did not contain a review clause.
While many people quite rightly consider that burglary is wrong, there is not somehow the same feeling about, for example, the illegal taking and using of intellectual property, for example, pirated CDs or using Napster to get other people' s music off the Internet.
As important as the protection of pregnant women is provision for breast-feeding, which is beneficial to the health of both mother and child.


On the other hand, the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative, administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and, at the same time, increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks.

For me it represents a sort of idyllic political consensus.



Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom. Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.

It has been proposed that it become the capital of both States.
The participation of the NGOs, the participation of ordinary people, clearly show that Europeans are interested in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
To say that Greece will be unable to sustain the criteria, I am sorry, but that is prejudging the facts.
hm
I would like to end by making a last observation to the Council, which has not taken part in this negotiation. It would perhaps be a good thing if the Council were also in a position and willing to adopt a standard of good conduct with Parliament in the budgetary field and in the political field.

The real solution is in Africa in the form of a development policy which enables Africans to live in their own countries, which raises the question of the alleged benefits of free trade.

Amendment No 32 is therefore not acceptable.
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.
The vote will take place today.
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.



To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.
If there is a difference of opinion between the Member States and the Commission on the financial correction to be imposed, we can call upon a conciliation body to mediate.

hi
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.
However, I shall be raising your concerns on pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, which a number of you mentioned, with my colleague Mr Liikanen and I will ask him to address those concerns.

This is a danger and risk to which we are alert.
Once again, it is the ideology and egoism of some which have prevailed over concern for the common good. The culture of death has taken priority over the defence of life.
It was cowardice to the highest degree that we failed to support the US initiative. Had we taken the much stronger position, then we would not be experiencing the arrogance that we see from China.
The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and political repression is on the increase.
assuming apt works for you now



Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.
I believe you would now find a much more positive response to a proposal for a directive than perhaps was the case with the previous administration.



I wish it would snow here




Madam President, I would not want Members of this House to think that I do not have a sense of humour.
Our work has been outstanding in this respect.


I do hope that does not mean that we are going to see a European Union regulation restricting us all to living in bungalows.
Naturally, thereafter, the debate should be redistributed through all forms of the media, but civil society should not be placed in opposition to Parliaments, because we live in representative democracies and we have to work out a complex system.
It was the point in which the macro-economy is arranged such that it will lead to employment.



At present, revenue is not earmarked for transport infrastructure.

We need to have affordable access to these media for all Europeans and the educational provision to make this possible.

It advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages. It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market.
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.
Since then, however, I have received apologies from a great number of members who intended to take part in this debate.
The failure throughout the former Yugoslavia has shown that European helplessness and fragmentation between the different governments do not lead to a prospect of joint peace.
We agree that review of the legislation should take account of aircraft emissions, further emission reductions in regions bordering on the Community, measures taken in applicant countries and transport factors.
Mr President, you said that recorded votes cost 4 million from Parliament' s budget.
There is a need for more expertise in this area if it is to be possible to carry out professional investigations.


I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.
The EET model, where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed, meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States.
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.

Mr Izquierdo Rojo had already replied to Mr Varaut and therefore, Mrs Lulling, you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue.
Whatever our beliefs or religious convictions, we are forced to acknowledge that John Paul II' s message is a major contribution to progress towards peace in the region.
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.


Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope. In fact, his name fills us with hope.



In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.



My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions.


Mr President, I should like to start by complimenting Mr Bowe on his objective and balanced presentation.
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.



The European Union must accept its due responsibilities, alongside our American counterparts.

oh I see.  Well, I usually use BitTorrent

That is my initial response to the threshold question.
Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which, I think, has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures.
Mr President, I had the honour of representing the European Parliament on the management committee of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and one of my colleagues there was Professor Doctor Anton Pelinka, representing the Austrian government.




As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.
Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most.
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.


This report, let me remind you, is based on the Commission' s annual economic report for 1999, the first of these to be published under the euro system, which, consequently, is more concerned with the single European economy than with a series of national economies.

The hushkits issue is also widely seen as a first case of how aviation issues will be dealt with in the future by the new Parliament and the new Commission.
In 1999, FAO joined the international relief operation by introducing a programme to improve nutrition standards among the most vulnerable households.
Our task is still far from complete, for sport is continually changing and Europe cannot afford not to follow these changes.
I was gunning for Portugal for as long as I possibly could, though.
The European Union calls throughout the world for freedom of movement for capital. But it is reducing the freedom of movement of persons yet further by closing borders and cutting itself off from refugees and asylum seekers.




I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.
With the predicted increase in incineration, it is vital that overall EU legislation on waste disposal and on air quality is consistent and comprehensive.
I will illustrate the importance of this with a historical reference: in the 1980 Venice Declaration, proposed by Ministers Genscher and Colombo, the Community first of all established the need for a solution to be found to the Palestinian question through negotiations.
Secondly, improving reception conditions should also include providing access to health care for all, the provision of education for children, and also training.

Secondly, to be absolutely clear and not to extend the debate, at no point did I suggest Mr Salafranca accused President Pastrana of bad faith.
We shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective.
Within the international community, either individually or through the European Union as a whole, the European countries have made an important contribution.
Only yesterday in this House we debated our priorities for the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
Amendments Nos 6, 8, 9 and 11, which propose the separation of the operators of infrastructures from the providers of services, clarify the text enormously.
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.


the report (A5-0208/2000) by Mr Mennea, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission to the European Council: With a view to safeguarding current sports structures and maintaining the social function of sport within the Community framework - The Helsinki report on sport [COM(1999) 644 - C5-0088/2000 - 2000/2055(COS)].

The framework agreement restricts this provision.
AndyFitz, are your panels there but blank?
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.
I support all the points that have been made and I would like to add another. I am talking about those people who cannot exercise their rights because they are under pressure from certain quarters, certain organisations.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although I did not agree with the individual points.
The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time.


http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/SenaoCard
I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next.
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.
Obviously, whilst nine years is not the perfect solution which Parliament originally sought, it is the best possible compromise.


the new indexes for water should be compulsory;
This is why the European Union needs to be given legal armour and to speed up the procedures to complete a common area of freedom, security and justice for everyone living on the territory of the European Union.





I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well.



I wish at this point to pay tribute to Mr Schori, who led this mission, and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team.
In a nutshell, the EU' s future Member States are making a direct appeal for solidarity to the current EU Members.
Mr President, our primary duty in the struggle to protect the civilian population, refugees and prisoners of war in Chechnya is to do everything to finally bring the war in Chechnya to an end.
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.
This question needs to be resolved urgently.
In this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer.
Governments are far too accommodating when agreements are not met, under the motto: you meet the agreements today, I might meet them tomorrow.

Transatlantic trade is still the thread of life as far as the global economy is concerned, and the importance of cooperation in this area must not be underrated.
On this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now.



Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.
i have 2 HD's
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Medina Ortega said, we too must reiterate the unfortunate position of the conflict in Colombia, and highlight that in the Peace Community in La Unión, in the region of Urabá, there have been three murders since 1997.
Some associations have even had to close down because of delays in payment by the Commission.
Both have a great deal of logistical experience, expertise and know-how.

I would ask what does "urgent" mean in this context?
The deep schism that divides the Mediterranean world is obvious.
If the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki is still caught up in so much red-tape that funding cannot be made available, then this is extremely serious.
Evaluation also aspires to becoming a lever which can be used to force schools to operate in a competitive environment in which the best schools attract the best pupils, the best teachers and the most funding - in other words to operate on market criteria.

I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.
In my own region, in some parts of my region, 17% of drivers tested were above the UK legal limit of 80 mg. It is quite clear that we need action.
We are most grateful for that.

During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.
The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23.
I believe that this is a positive way of forcing the tyre industry to act.
The second point concerns the budget.


Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.

We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.

I feel that, in setting limits on the number of lorries which can use the tunnel, the French and Italian authorities have exercised good sense.
The European Parliament is today offering this report to which I refer as food for thought for everyone on the eve of an historic reform of the common fisheries policy, so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to.

Judge the Austrian government by its deeds.
Screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the European Union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country' s legislation and how much does not.
It is important that we retain the commitment set out in the Geneva Convention and a humane approach.



Despite the progress announced here today, we feel that more than ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall the European Union should be showing a more consistent political will in terms of welcoming into the European fold the people of Central and Eastern Europe who legitimately aspire to share a common future with us. This would prevent them from feeling any disappointment or even frustration.
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?


Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, it was a difficult birth, but in the end it was a successful birth.
SimonTek: yes, I know, try the list

We make virtually no use of it at all.
Lastly, I heard Mr Poos say earlier that this IGC 2000 was not the end of the story.
This does not figure in the directive but, in my experience as an MEP, we often hear complaints when we visit SMEs and large companies alike, that the Commission is often far too late honouring the payment commitments which it has entered into in research promotion or other areas.
The issues and debates we face are increasingly complex and politicians will soon have to be multilingual and multicultural scientific experts as well, if they want to understand and not accept the word of experts as gospel.

Officially, according to MARPOL and other conventions, waste is required to be handed over. In practice, however, it appears that this does not happen.

However, because of the special issue of over-worked junior doctors in the UK, as Conservative MEPs we voted last November to extend the directive to them.
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.



We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.





That budget was entirely the responsibility of the previous Commission, but we are discussing it with the present Prodi Commission, which has started to adopt better management and examine incidents of fraud in the past.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also thinks that the programme should include other languages which are actually used in the various Member States, for instance Catalan in Spain and Frisian in the Netherlands.
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.

sure i can

In conclusion, I will say - so much is clear - that we should not introduce confusion between the discharge procedure, which represents an overall appreciation of the management of the European Commission as laid down by the Treaty, and the handling of a number of isolated matters which, although clearly serious, are still only isolated cases and represent a low figure with regard to the total budget.
azta: I don't think so
My question is therefore as follows: in the context of negotiations with a view to Turkey' s accession to the European Union, has the issue of this blockade been raised, and could lifting this blockade be counted a precondition to Turkey' s accession?

One of the crucial factors is that, if the system is managed and implemented by the Commission, there is a guarantee of effective control by the European Parliament.
Mr President, allow me to ask Commissioner Byrne one more question.


In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred, let me summarise the situation as follows: the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region.


This committee forms the interface between the European citizen, the European Parliament and the Commission.
I want to address a second point.

It is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone.


In solidarity with all the millions of people who suffer from this terrible disease, I can only express my shame on behalf of the honourable Member, Silvio Berlusconi.

We have heard and we know what it costs SMEs, what it costs the European economy, what it costs workers when certain companies, which can and do throw their financial and purchasing weight around, or public sectors which can and do throw their weight around, acquire extra liquidity free of charge, at no cost to them, but at the expense, mainly, of SMEs.

Otherwise we shall never manage to get more freight back on to the railways because this is precisely the problem faced by certain railways, including the German railways, to quote just one example: when the complete cost-covering method is used in the present situation, many companies refuse to use the railways' services because they are simply too expensive.
This is why it is useful and necessary to have this report, although it has been a long time coming. However, all credit to Mr Skinner for finally managing to complete it.
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.

New freight goes by road in Europe, not by rail.

If you are increasing qualified majority voting and therefore taking away the national veto, you are effectively transferring powers from the nation state to the European institutions.


It is obvious that economic issues are shaping a genuine rapprochement between the two continents, a fact which cannot be hidden by the individual positions of some Member States, which have a limited but positive influence. I am referring in particular to external debt relief for the LDCs.

Reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right.
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.

The Secretary-General has mentioned a few procedural reasons, but is this the full story?
The publishing industry feels that there is a lack of recognition of its particular requirements with regard to the expanding IT sector.

It established the content of these rights and approved instruments allowing these rights to be gradually consolidated. As usually happens with this type of international instrument, it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed.

The European Union says that it intends to protect women from such unacceptable persecution and punishment, but it has not yet found a way of translating its declarations into political actions and decisions offering grounds for hope.

That is why it is very much in our interest to make sure that Russia gradually becomes a democratic state where the rule of law prevails.

The draft seeks to lay down a Dublin-style system for illegal immigrants, following the model of the Convention on asylum seekers, the application of which, as we know, has proven to be highly problematic and ineffective.
Given the fragmented commitment of the Member States, also in the future, the report is right to call for a system of information exchange.

Once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has BSE, then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that, then the whole herd should be taken out.



This is why, all in all, I am delighted with the Commission' s recommendation that is now before us.
Point two: research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system.



Our European Parliament has a vital role to play in the formulation and practical application of EU human rights policy.

Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.
It is also the duty of Parliament to examine the question of human rights in the candidate countries in a systematic way.
But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.

Having said this, we also want this dialogue to have an objective basis, as have the declarations of the new President, Chen Shui-bian, to which, however, the People' s Republic of China has replied with a renewed display of nervousness, arrogance and a disrespect for democracy.
If we are dissatisfied with the laws, we can choose new representatives and obtain new laws.



Mr Schulz, we have noted your statement.

The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European Union's external action priorities.
So this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous.



The Court of Auditors is now proposing, as it did back in its 1999 Annual Report, that international organisations should not be granted project financing but should be allowed budgetary grants instead.
Those parliamentary members that compiled the list were obviously right.
It is, of course, right for us to consider our health as human beings and to slaughter the huge number of animals at risk; it is right for us to adopt this measure and thereby establish rules to bring farmers and stock breeders into line, but we also need to keep our feet firmly on the ground.

The third point I should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid.

Mr President, the previous Commission worked under the motto "do less in order to do better" , as opposed to the supposedly active approach of the Delors Commission.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Maat very sincerely for the effort he has made to present a balanced report on the Commission proposal.
Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002, the Commission' s interpretation of the conclusions of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for progressive withdrawal adopted at international level.
The latest crisis in the foodstuffs sector may justify the introduction of stricter standards, as contained in the report; however, where possible, red tape should be reduced.

The communication updates the list of priorities for the opening of new delegations and offices.

After all, normally the Commission's proposals always take account of the Member States' views, and perhaps in future they will also take more account of Parliament's views.

Why, for example, could we not take up the notion that a certain number of citizens - let us say from three different EU countries - could formulate a citizens' initiative that then could be channelled though the European Parliament?
Processing aid has to be in reasonable proportion to production costs and take account of the market value of the products.

In the debate in those countries which are not participating in the third phase of EMU and which are not therefore becoming a part of the euro zone, the point has been made that ministers from these countries are losing influence, not only on issues directly affecting the euro, but also on other issues dealt with by Ecofin.

Mr President, I think there is every reason to thank both the Commission and Mr Arvidsson: the Commission because, in spite of criticism, it has come up with a proposal in this area, and Mr Arvidsson because I think that, with his report, we are obtaining a responsible framework for the use of phthalates in toys.
The average yields of flax and hemp are very similar across Europe, in the North as well as the South.
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.

I say: Let it be now.
Although these companies have proved to be a risk once, that does not mean that the same thing will happen in the future.

No Khmer Rouge leaders has ever been tried and only two are in detention, one being the person who ran a notorious torture centre in Phnom Penh from which only seven out of more than fourteen thousand inmates emerged alive.


Since it no longer appears possible for events to take place in this way, because the political groups have already distributed Members' speaking times, I would ask that, in this case, the Commission statement should be the first item so that Members may speak in the debate and so that the Commission statement is not made in the middle of the debate, which would prevent all Members from being in an equal position to respond to this statement by the Commission.

Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.
The funds required for this task need to be anchored in the budget accordingly.

It is true that covers mainly countries from Central and Eastern Europe, but the candidate countries include the two famous Mediterranean island peoples: the Maltese and the Cypriots.
We need reliable information on final beneficiaries, the number of animals kept and the surface area being cultivated.




Mr President, the matter addressed by Mrs Klamt' s truly excellent report is one of the most burning and ever growing issues of our time, to which a solution must urgently be found.

We must however recognise that Community legislation would not be necessary if the Member States of the European Union, who are all signatories to Marpol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, had taken the necessary steps.
If the Council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer.
ahhhh
I therefore feel we are enjoying a very positive and constructive atmosphere, in which we can tackle tasks such as that before us today.
mako: fooooooooooooooood
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.
This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence, but, ladies and gentlemen, if you give up a specific definition of chocolate, then at least do so clearly and openly.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, according to which decisions are to be made as close as possible to the people they affect.

Animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically.
The Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that we must keep to what was agreed in the plenary a number of months ago, namely a situation in which the agricultural budget serves as a primary source of funding for external EU action should never arise.
People in work are a guarantee of peace and freedom in Europe.
Parliament must reiterate what it has declared many times in recent years, including last May.
Together with these three Italian citizens, there are three other Europeans and thousands of Colombians.

We cited it as an example in our recent proposals for the overall reform of our external assistance programmes.

I will attend to it this week.
Furthermore, paragraph 8 calls for, and I quote, "the operational bodies responsible for ATC to be privatised" .
eek .. Need to get 161MB/163MB of archives.
karlos, i don't know jack ;P
Despite this, these texts too are of value because they send out a message.

Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.
As far as staffing policy is concerned, in your report you specifically focused on the issue of the legal basis for the early retirement scheme.


The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.

And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.

I should like to state clearly at this point that this redeployment will not of course have any effect on income support for farmers.
We are major donors but we have, unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many speakers have said today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland.
Cloning, including therapeutic cloning, is the first step along the way to human beings being regarded merely as biological material.
I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Mr van den Bos on anti-personnel mines today.


Attaining the World Health Organisation' s target values is only the first step.
BEFORE everyone had to live off writing media players :(
Secondly, the proposed reduction in the ceiling under heading 1a for the year 2002 does not prejudice the measures in any particular production sector either.


The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.

The combination of these two positions makes for a mixture which could be disastrous for the future for Europe.

I would therefore like to assure everyone that this is why it is sensible to opt for a system in which indirect costs are somehow absorbed in port dues.


In connection with the debate on the report, we have pointed out that the present directive only deals with discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin.




That is why I think that the procedure proposed here is correct.

The governments have one sole objective: to reach a unanimous agreement in Nice, whatever the outcome, so that they do not have to move on to some other city as obscure as Maastricht.
Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice.

Mrs de Palacio said earlier that she will need Parliament' s support at some point for the second part of the regulation, the part relating to third countries, including the United States, South America and the countries of eastern Europe, i.e. all countries outside the European Union.




The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.

The situation appears worse in certain regions of Southern Europe, in particular in the South of Italy, where 21.9% of the workforce is unemployed, including 56.6% of the 14-25 age group.
It would therefore be impossible to require a company to find out beforehand about the consumer protection legislation that exists in the customer' s country, as that country could be anywhere.



I intend to present proposals within the next several days on all these issues to the Standing Veterinary Committee.
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.
Here again, if we repeat something that has already been defined, it is a potential for conflicting interpretations.

We want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the European Union.

The European Parliament has approached this matter very seriously with, in particular, two resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1988, which provide a frame of reference for the action to be undertaken in this field.
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.


In any event, I would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies.

Indeed, the national authorities are the first to apply Community law and it is indispensable for them to work in coordination with the European institutions, and in particular Parliament and the Commission.
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.
We have chosen to vote against Amendments Nos 16 and 17, because these proposals, in a much too general and undifferentiated way, relieve small Member States of the need to achieve the environmental goals that have been established.
We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency.
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.
Secondly, the importance of the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea' s adopting a responsible attitude when it comes to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, as well as putting a stop to exports of missiles.
- (SV) The most important development for the EU' s future right now is that the Intergovernmental Conference should reach agreement concerning the reforms which are required in order to facilitate the enlargement of the Union in accordance with a fixed timetable.
What about localized websites? What if a country team cannot provide the hosting himself? will canonical be in help of that?
Here I am talking about a Europe of thirty Members.
The document on which we are preparing to vote deplores the slide towards intergovernmentalism which is creeping into our common foreign and security policy and that this somewhat contradicts the Commissioner' s speech this morning, in which he said that foreign policy would remain a matter for national governments.


I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda, namely the Commission' s work programme for 2000.



We are also pleased that the ECB now recognises that OLAF must be able to carry out internal audits. However, it is a great pity about the delay involved.

Thank you, Mr Martin, for your assessment.
I therefore feel that, laying aside political differences, this House should send a signal, a message expressing our solidarity, to the teacher who was attacked simply because he is of the Jewish race.
It is extremely urgent to take this matter further.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.


These measures, which have already been successfully implemented in some States, must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union.
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.





I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge.
There are two fundamental courses of development behind this: on the one hand, the pressures caused by the liberalisation of world trade on reducing export aid and, on the other, the EU' s internal budgetary pressures mainly associated with external relations.

The report which we are debating today and voting on tomorrow also seems to explain very clearly what the political objectives of this Parliament are.


This restates the obligation on transporters to do everything they can to ensure that the passengers they are carrying have travel documents and, if appropriate, the necessary visas. This mechanism also restates the transporter' s obligation to send back or to accept responsibility for sending back foreign nationals who have not been allowed to enter for the reasons I have just mentioned.



This contrasts with the 100% rise in the cost to rail, and the 50% rise in the cost to internal navigation.

This is the crux of the matter.

The first chapter of the European Charter on the Rights of the Child states that 'child' refers to any person under the age of 18.
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems. At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.
Mr Rübig, look upon it as an exceptional decision taken in response to specific requests from the Portuguese Presidency.
As we have already discussed, at the heart of the proposal is, of course, the duty on the part of ships to report and to deliver waste.

thx
Everyone is different, everyone is equal.


If you look at refugee movements, you will see that they always affect the same countries.

Most countries are by now well under way with implementing extensive changes to the structures of their markets.
So, with those reservations I congratulate the Commission and the President-in-Office and look forward to an improvement in human rights in the coming year.



Airports' runway capacity, airline planning, passenger behaviour, airport infrastructure, as well as the shortage of controllers which was mentioned by the rapporteurs.
I refer in particular to the statement made last week by Alain Richard, Minister for Defence of the country holding the presidency, in which he expressed his concern in the event that non-aligned countries are fully involved from the start in second pillar development projects.

The next item is the Commission communication on the external relations package.


Madam President, the rapporteur, Mr Valdivielso, has just informed our group that the amendments are not yet all available in translation.
Now that the scope of aid has been widened, quite rightly in my opinion, from just cereals, this would be even more difficult.


But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.

My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.
Mr President, concerning the motion for a resolution, I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament' s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures.
With regard to the municipal elections of 28 May, there are grounds for concern, because to date there has been no guarantee of any democratic conditions for these elections.
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.
Despite being asked to do so, you were not prepared to be more specific at the time.

For the purpose of agreement and the speedy implementation of this regulation and hopefully to avoid a lengthy conciliation process, the use of common OIE criteria would be appropriate.
To create more uniformity, the Commission intends to present a proposal by the end of the year aiming to harmonise certain ships' arrival and departure documents.
This debate should therefore be a separate and very, very specific task for us and the Commission.
We therefore call on the Commission to begin with determination the procedures to suspend development cooperation with Fiji.
The decision to exonerate the previous director was taken by the previous Commission, and this was a political decision pure and simple.
It is an important area and she has rightly drawn attention to it.


As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.


The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank very warmly, depicts very varied trends in expenditure under the Structural Funds. The picture is one of some positive aspects compared with previous years, combined with continuing problems.

The general interpretation is, in fact, that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality.
Nevertheless, four weeks ago, Mr President, I was crossing the road near the Gare du Nord in Brussels, and a shiver went down my spine because it was night, you could have heard a pin drop, and I saw a tram pass behind me in complete silence.
Member States should ensure that the current VAT rules applying to books be monitored and mirrored for electronic publication.



So what you want, if I have understood properly - and I also want to check with the rapporteurs - is for us to vote on paragraph 29 with an oral amendment.


The report presents the situation as if all were well with the farming world.
Mr President, I put an extremely topical and extremely precise question to the President of the Commission about his view of the relationship between freedom of expression and responsibility for cooperating loyally with the institutions.
Mr President, we must anticipate this, as Europe must opt for secure, stable, quality work, and undeclared work is neither stable nor secure and nor, of course, does it demonstrate solidarity.

The Treaty of Amsterdam, as I have already stated, enables the European Union to make this contribution.
The victims were a group of young people with banners and flags who were demonstrating against globalisation and genetically modified organisms. Water was thrown out of one of the Parliament offices - I do not know whether it was in a bucket or another container - by, it appears, a Member of Parliament, who then protested in the Chamber against the demonstration.
I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules.
got my cd's just now



- (FR) I want to draw a parallel between the reports by Mrs Ludford and Mr Haarder and the report by Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber.
In fact, what will happen with the reserved 13% for the Kurds in the unlikely event that the sanctions are lifted?



What it needs is the European and American multinationals to stop bleeding it dry. It needs Europe to provide the African people with simple machinery, such as water pumps and industrial products to compensate for what it plundered throughout colonial times and afterwards.
Our doors are always open to any debate or any negotiations that will help us to arrive at a consensus.


These are Amendments 5, 6, 10, 17, 43, 44 and 45, according to which organisations must apply best available technology.

Separation of waste, including use of organic waste for composting, must be a priority in any waste strategy.



Thanks to the legal basis that now exists we are able to fund these orphan drugs.

Mr President, I am similarly dismayed at the way in which Austria continues to be prejudged by 14 Member States and in my view, despite the many words of praise about the Portuguese Presidency, the absurdity of the sanctions against Austria, which Member States agreed together but are applying bilaterally, will, as a German newspaper once wrote, go down as a peculiar irony in the history of the EU and therefore unfortunately also in the history of the Portuguese Presidency.
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme
My group also sees the increased European presence in the region over recent months as something to be greatly welcomed.
Quite the contrary, we think we should move towards a much more limited list, and remove the most suspect additives from the list.



If we are frank, we will admit that no government has yet found a way to offer adequate protection to its citizens.
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.
(Applause)There is therefore some ambiguity, if you will, and the more of us there are, the more essential it will be to enforce strict application of the principle of subsidiarity. This, of course, means that there must be a standard set of rules to avoid any sort of ambiguity.

In my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive.
beep & disown
It is still too easy for hooligans to move around with complete impunity within the countries of the European Union.
You see, it emerged that during the plenary part-sessions there is a significant rise in prostitution in the area, in Strasbourg.
States and governments should amend the measures for the promotion of preventive actions, for the inspection of the measures to prevent accidents, and also for the replacement of the administrative and political methods for combating accidents at work.
- (DE) In 1993 the Federal Republic of Germany watered down the right to political asylum in its constitution, thus sealing its borders against immigration by asylum-seekers.


This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.

The regional failure to observe the principle of additionality aggravates the situation with regard to internal regional disparities within Member States, which runs counter to the aims of the Union' s regional policy.
Mr Gollnisch, You have exceeded your allocated speaking time.
The issue of North-South relations is spectacularly alive in the Mediterranean.

Now, 60 years after the Nazi invasion of 1940 and 55 years after the end of a horrible European and world conflict, how can some people, for base electioneering purposes, have 'such short memories' ?
Madam President, I am speaking as coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.
This ranges from precise filing rules, so that documents cannot simply disappear, to a fundamental reform of disciplinary proceedings and much else besides.

I don't want to format them, because I would lose a ton of my music.
just to compile it


Still today, the way in which the agro-industry is organised, and the fact that it is infiltrated by international mafia-like networks, make the fight to eradicate BSE and TSEs even more difficult.

The first is the legal competence of the European Union to fight racism.





Would one not criticise this kind of situation in, let us say, Zimbabwe or some other part of the world, if it arose there?
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.


It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.

Only on that basis should a Convention be convened, with the participation of constitutional experts, experts in European law, representatives of the national parliaments, of the European Parliament, of the national governments, but also of the governments of the candidate states and, of course, of the Court of Justice and of civil society. They would be charged with drafting a proposal for a inventory, and to do so by around Spring 2003.



I now turn to the issues raised in the Belder report which responds to the Commission' s communication on countering racism, xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries.






Not only was Euro 2000 a superb festival of football, it was also a festival of solidarity among the citizens of the European Union, whom it brought closer together.
It will transfer an increased share of the state budget to businesses in that sector, with the goal of establishing a European military industry (EADS, Dassault, BAE) capable of getting the better of the United States.
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.

ECHO programmes in the northern Caucusus cover a broad range of aid sectors, for example, food, medical aid, shelter, water, sanitation, essential relief items and psycho-social assistance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are agreed on one thing: policy on trans-European networks is in urgent need of reform!

Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?
In fact, the draft version of this Charter will be considered by the Industry Council tomorrow and the Charter will be published in three weeks.
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.
As it stands, the project, which favours the relaunch of rail in the Alpine region to reverse the increase of freight traffic on roads decisively, will be appropriately supplemented by the development of new rail routes.


Anyway, that is precisely what the Lisbon Council has just agreed to reject in connection with the job markets.



However, I would like to hear a clear commitment from the Commission that it will seek a solution for the speedy transposition into Community law of the recommendations of the regional and international fishing organisations.
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.






I think that again shows that many aspects of the financial perspectives facilitate work and planning, especially where firm agreements are concluded between the institutions.
Norway has much the same problems as Sweden when it comes to drugs crossing the border.


It is a complicated issue and, of course, it concerns local authorities and the national government.
4 cd's, all freezing at different points
I must say that the preparatory and construction measures have always been based on the agreed lines, and that to deviate from that initial approach would cause a significant delay in the development of the project itself.
Also, as others said, the risk of a negative spillover in the region should also be taken into consideration when we are deciding what our measures should be.
This scourge, like so many others, has certainly always existed and regrettably will no doubt always exist, but our task as elected representatives forces us to take a better and wider perspective, regarding what destroys the human being not as an inevitability but as a crime to be combated.
This itself presupposes another prerequisite, which is that the common interests of the Member States must be defined. This prerequisite in turn presupposes another, consisting of defining a common link between Europe and the rest of the world.
The EU is at present adopting legislation to promote mobility and road safety.



In Helsinki, it was confirmed that the development of ESDP should take place within the existing institutional framework.


This silence is in stark contrast with our condemnation of what else goes wrong in the world.
We understand that has already commenced, but there is a long way to go.
We take the view that it is high time, eight years after the completion of the single market, to set signals and regulate conclusively so that the liberalisation of the railway sector can be completed by 2010.

And do we really think that the Constitutions of all of our nations are racist because their criteria are different from those espoused by Baroness Ludford?

It was this House which, following its first direct election in 1979, was the first to give repressed peoples a moral voice, although it had virtually no powers at that time.
However, we need a directive in order to harmonise the internal market and prevent such unilateral regulations.
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.


Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP, and the same concerns about unanimity apply here.


My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.
Given that we are negotiating with the candidate countries with the aim of their acceding in 2004/2005, how then, can we make it clear to them that, even if they join under the current conditions, they cannot rely on our being able to continue the system, in other words, how are we going to make them understand that irrespective of what they sign up to now, they are going to have to adapt to an amended cohesion policy?
We have given everyone, including the Presidents, the opportunity to change the agenda if this was considered necessary.

This would constitute the first step towards a European public service that met the needs of today' s users and employees.
programs in windows come with depends

That cannot work and it does not work.


At the same time, the Saint Andrés agreements and the rights of the indigenous peasants are not being observed.
They often involve ruthless traders who only have their own self-interests at heart.
Our Group welcomes it with open arms, and I do not think that organised crime will receive this report with too much enthusiasm.
The basic pillars of the work of the Ombudsman are independence and transparency.


However, some large Member States are fearful to take the required measures, as a result of which they lose out on the benefits to be gained from economic growth.

You see, you cannot help but notice a certain contradiction in the fact that these measures were intended to be entirely political and were also taken at political level and yet to find a way out of this blind alley - which is entirely desirable and in everyone's interests - a solution is now having to be sought by means of a legal instrument.
On the other hand we must realise that Parliament is saving money, as the investment it is making is a most prudent one.

Human rights are, of course, indivisible and independent of political parties and national borders. It is therefore important that we in this Parliament should obtain broad agreement on this issue, for a right cannot, of course, be universal if half of Parliament is opposed to it.

Report (A5-0170/2000) by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on communications strategy in the last phases of the completion of EMU (COM(2000) 57 - C5-0104/2000 - 2000/2019(COS))




URL?
Of course I disapprove of the criminal machinations of the feedingstuffs industry, the lack of controls by the authorities and so forth, but it is all this together which has resulted in the chaos in which more and more members of the profession find themselves.

In our opinion, the report does not go far enough regarding another point, namely that relating to individual responsibility which must be granted by Commissioners.
We also need new sustainable technologies.





Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.
Only the Budgetary Authority is entitled to determine annual financial provisions in the budget.

Marble2: In windows I miss the middle click to paste.
It is our duty to take an interest in these children, particularly the girls, because in some countries they are still regarded as domestic slaves.



We condemn these amendments, which would lead to what I would also call a nonsense in industrial terms.


I therefore agree with what is stated in Mrs Haug' s report, namely that we must insist that these appropriations for Special Envoys remain on the Commission' s budget, for we in that way ensure continued parliamentary inspection and control and ensure that Parliament continues, for example, to be listened to and kept informed. In the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have been sufficiently constructive, however, as to think also about how a medium-term solution might possibly be found in a situation where negotiations with the Council were taking place.
We would ask the Commission, especially in the beginning, to carry out many and frequent assessments, and to report on these to our Parliament.

The EU presidency and the Commission delegation are members of that group.
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.


We make it abundantly clear that we strive for fair competition and utilisation of our internal market but, when the chips are down, we are once again looking solely after our own interests.



More recently operations have increasingly been focusing on Chechnya itself.
In order to facilitate the change-over to the new rules the Commission, based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty, proposed amendments to the directive that include transitional measures to solve the most acute trade problems, minor corrections and clarifications in the annexes and a general mandate to the Commission to lay down transitional measures in accordance with the new comitology procedure included in the proposal.
As the Feira conclusions emphasise, it is particularly important to develop Europol' s role in curbing the traffic in human beings.

What counts is the quality of cooperation with South Africa, which, in my opinion, is sound at present, particularly on account of the regional projects which have been financed over the past couple of years.
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.

The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.
It has therefore submitted proposals accordingly, and, has also restructured the Commission' s veterinary service as a result.
Science and practice have shown for some time now that such a measure does not prevent high emissions of hydrogen chlorides and dioxins.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
If we could manage to make Turkey more open and more cooperative on the Cyprus question, that would be a very positive development.

anir: besides, who will help you with lindows? lindows is by far, far, far NOT linux mainstream.
We can only congratulate our colleague, Mr de Roo, and support him in his efforts to include noise pollution in the context of protecting the environment.
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.
Conversely, I believe we delegates should consider taking our example from the relations between the legislative bodies, the American Congress for example, and Asia, because contact between the European Parliament and Asia is not firmly established enough yet.
The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding.


I am glad that 11 of my 12 amendments were accepted in committee.
We must tackle a dreadful scourge, the sexual exploitation of children.
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright.
I know that I need to be flexible, but please do not try to take advantage of this.

Europe is thus creating a good reputation for itself on the cheap.

anyone upgraded to the latest alsa for sound blaster card use with 2.6.8?
Given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted, I would like to ask the Council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with Parliament.

Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.




probably there should be a place to upload for all the ppl that can not pay for the traffic.....

Another word on foreign policy: the Budget Council has cut the funding for the Mediterranean programme - which is also something you mentioned - by EUR 150 million.
I have the honour to be appointed as the rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the Structural Funds guidelines 2000-2006 and the committee agreed on that occasion, based on our recommendations to the Regional Policy Committee, that the Commission should pay attention to this issue of additionality.

Hopefully, the paper will contain good, concrete proposals, but I also hope that we can still put some effort into the SLIM project.
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.


That concludes Questions to the Council.

just ask daniels ;)
Allow me simply to offer the Vice-President a helping hand so that she might support Amendment No 3 - which replaces No 2 - after all.






Mr President, the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention.

We have confidence in the Member States and we defend the common position. The 'environment' alibi is nothing more than the instrument the European Union uses to extend its control in all policy areas.
This is the price for peace.
They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute.
The European Union - and we have debated human rights, xenophobia and discrimination at length over the past few days - must fight against this extremism with all the means at its disposal wherever it occurs, at home, in the candidate countries or throughout the entire world.
However, we must not forget that we are also talking, with reasonable certainty, about the harmful effects of six phthalates, and also, with a degree of uncertainty, of the other substances belonging to this group.

I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.

I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.
One is what I have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation.
For example, I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate, so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least.


To ban all of the 350 or so currently known phthalates is to proceed on the assumption that all phthalates are associated with more or less the same risks.


The political signal which we must all send out together and the instruments which are decided upon must be capable of successfully relaunching this policy and restoring its status.

Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.


Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.

E-commerce and e-business certainly have a great future.


Mr President, at the present time the United Kingdom has rates of fuel duty which are spectacularly higher than in other parts of the European Union.


This information is obtained mainly from the newspapers.



And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.

Quest-Master: thank you, i can cope with that ..... in fact he warned me ;)

Indeed I will be calling on my own government in Ireland to refuse to participate in this rapid reaction force unless there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used.

But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.



The European Union, through its highest expression of democracy, the European Parliament, condemns the occurrence of such an incident within its borders.
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.

You can request and propose - that is, a political group or at least thirty-two Members can do so - adjourning the debate to another time in Parliament' s schedule, but only at the beginning of the debate.
Madam President, we are holding this debate at exactly the right time.
Finally, there is talk of guaranteeing coordinated representation in the EU and other international bodies.

The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.

Kamion: how can i identify that via CONFIG_* in the kernel?



Between 1990 and 1999, this system led to expenditure totalling EUR 725 million.
Madam President, I did inform you of what happened in that debate and why it did not continue, and it did not do so basically because there was insistence on the issue of the Tapie case.
Is she really prepared to tell people such as those whom I represent in Merseyside and the North-West of England that they must lose Structural Funds because their governments have failed to comply with the habitats directive?


To begin with, there is the issue of control, especially quota control, within the EU.

Nevertheless, I must say that Mr Blokland is proposing some regulations and stringent conditions for the directive which go way beyond the objective.
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to explain the point he was making on the amendment.

Since 1997, we have been trying to carry out coherent work in this respect, and we have had some successes.

This will depend on us, on whether we are able to boost the economic growth of the European system sufficiently, on the extent to which we are able to generate employment, on the level of education of our citizens and on the training we give our workers.
We did have a statement by the Commission for 2000-2006 and that set out certain perimeters within which agricultural spending would be provided for.
Here the promotion of democracy is the first rule, combined with principles of tolerance and pluralism; not a pluralism which is free from values, but a pluralism geared precisely towards these human rights.

Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .

In all, there are 140 000 cross-border workers in Switzerland who come from Germany, France, Italy and Austria.
One notes, moreover, that the preamble to the proposal for a directive refers virtuously to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the international covenant of 1966, which recognise that "the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State" .
The Committee on Budgets transferred EUR 38 million of unused funds this year by means of a C6/2000 to fund this office space, the Spinelli building.
Mr Posselt, that is an announcement of an intervention of almost twenty minutes during the debate on the Deprez report.
It is inhuman and ineffective to advocate the free movement of goods and capital but not of people.
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.


The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0065/2000) by Mr Deva, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation (EC) extending Regulation (EC) No 443/97 on operations to aid uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries [COM(1999) 443 - C5-0146/1999 - 1999/0194 (COD)]

The Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme known as EMAS afforded an opportunity to EU companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations.
Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium.

guys I need help, left apt to update to hoary overnight, got errors configuring some packages, namely base-config , console-data and console-common.. yet checking most of the packages on finds that they weren't updated, although there's new versions of these packages in /var/cache/apt/archives and running apt-get upgrade again doesn't update them
They are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time.

We know that it is not impossible that more people will yet be affected by this accident.
Madam President, I had understood that Mr Verheugen was going to give a full explanation of the interview that he gave to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.

This kind of Europe is based on a new totalitarianism in which man finds himself alone facing a Community administration that is as remote as it is impersonal, in which the intermediate structures - and in particular the most vital one of all, the family - have been gradually destroyed.


I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.

And I am quite sure the IGC will not retain the current wording of paragraph 32.
What matters is that traceability is effective and efficient, not only to protect the consumer, but also the whole meat chain.


Here too, Mr Prodi, I would like to sound the alarm, and I would call upon the Commission to put forward new measures which are properly suited to managing this type of crisis, in addition, obviously, to what you are already proposing, i.e. a solidarity fund.

We have just achieved, this week, a working document to re-evaluate the Dublin Convention itself.
On my second point - flight time limitations, which are already highly regulated and agreed through national governments - civil aviation is now included in working time regulation.





Our concern has reached proportions which you cannot begin to imagine here in the House, at least among public opinion in my country.


Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.

This is the case for Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 11, amendments which the Commission welcomes.

Without a constant and intense effort in these fields there will be no competitiveness and a lack of competitiveness means no new jobs will be created.

(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Opening up to other cultures and finding out about the traditions of our European neighbours are essential ways of combating intolerance and racism engendered by fear of the unknown.
In Iran, we have a situation where newspapers are being banned for simply acting as a voice for those forces and individuals who were so successful in the last election, and who embodied - and continue to embody - hopes of pluralism in Iran.


I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests, but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own devastated forests.


First, the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and, second, the growing areas have to be brought under better control.
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.

Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.
On the financial reference amount, briefly, we accept the compromise proposals put forward under Amendment No 11.


Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously.
Madam President, I should like to leave it here.



Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.
Contact points or special units shall be set up in the Member States according to the draft.

I am sure that it would be possible to include the matter and we could also decide to instruct the negotiators to take it into account.
I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7.

The recent tragic accidents in England, however, and the many accidents on privatised networks, such as the German network, are constant emphatic reminders of the damage that is done by privatising this public service.
wood1: this is irc. not a forum.

It was in this spirit that the Group of the Party of European Socialists collaborated with the rapporteurs, Mrs Morgantini and our friend, Mr Naïr.
I therefore feel that it is right and proper for the European Union to intervene in cases where the Member States are not managing to achieve sufficient success in important areas such as the reduction of occupational accidents.

I would like to add that I share the opinion of Mrs Díez González and I also share the view that the European Union has the capacity to put a man on the moon, but has yet to demonstrate it.

it just says an error occured, and there's nothing helpful on the log tailing screen

It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.

The situation in these prisons is indescribable.
For this reason and this reason alone we, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today - which would in fact bring the total to seven - and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution.

Allow me to illustrate the constantly widening gulf that exists between, on the one hand, the principles contained in the conventions and, on the other hand, current observance of these by pointing out that, in conflicts in the course of the last decade, 10 times as many civilians have been killed as soldiers.
Mr President, the European Community is not a party to CITES.

A few suggestions that may be included in such a strategy are, for example, that the Council could develop its own human rights indicators that could be used in connection with trade agreements.
Lastly, on 28 March, there was the arrest and reimprisonment of Akin Birdal, President of the Turkish Association for the Defence of Human Rights, at a time when a delegation from this Parliament was visiting Turkey.
I know that the Turkish authorities are greatly saddened by recent events.



Mr President, I am presenting a report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation with regard to information measures relating to the common agricultural policy.
Equally, it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is excluded.
It must, however, be pointed out that the European Union' s budgetary resources fall considerably short of the requirements and the challenge generated by the establishment of a trans-European transport network.


as the first time
Officials working at the Schengen external borders are constantly telling us that the residence permits presented by third country nationals and issued by other EU Member States still vary widely and are often difficult to identify as such.

We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.
He has been correct, specifically in his proposals to limit and rationalise the use of the system of inward processing by adapting it to the situation of the markets, the regulatory framework and the budgetary framework.
That is what this is about.

It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.


This means that the supply must be guaranteed - as some of you have said - and there must be an adequate service for all citizens.


To prevent a repeat of the promise of prosperity for all thanks to technology, but without any change to social structures, we need a debate on power and the distribution of resources.
The impression is left that we are foot-dragging, but in fact we are not getting complete answers to the questions put by Mr Bösch and Mr Blak.
Parliament' s amendment takes the Commission' s proposal one step further.
Finally, again, something I have heard you, Mr President, talk about: the issue of legal advice.


The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
The matter being discussed is an important tool, but the compulsory labelling of beef products and the gradual switch to labels showing the origin of the meat do not serve this purpose.
Thus, as well as the special envoy, I think that the time has come for the European Union to set up a task force consisting of representatives from the Commission, the Council and, yes why not, the European Parliament - after all we have two eminent parliamentary representatives from countries in the region here today - to work out detailed proposals and positions on specific issues being addressed during the current peace process and on any issues which we need to bear in mind in the period following the agreement.

trukulo: thank you it now loaded the theme, however the icons do not load, do they have to go anywhere specific ? it's gtk2







If people would look at what is being done with the buildings: we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time, thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament's budget.
The next item is the report (A5-0118/2000) drawn up by Mr Carraro, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreements between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (7260/2000 - COM(1999) 229 - C5­0204/2000): 1. on the free movement of persons (9748/1999 - C5­0197/2000­1999/0103(AVC)); 2. on air transport (9749/1999 - C5­0198/2000 - 1999/0104(AVC)); 3. on the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road (9750/1999 - C5­0199/2000 - 1999/0105(AVC)); 4. on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (9751/1999 - C5­0200/2000 - 1999/0106(AVC)); 5. on certain aspects relating to public procurement (9752/1999 - C5­0201/2000 - 1999/0107(AVC)); 6. on trade in agricultural products (9753/1999 - C5­0202/2000 - 1999/0108(AVC)); 7. on mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation (9755/1999 - C5­0203/2000 - 1999/0109(AVC))
Examples would be the positive experience that was gained from the common standardisation of second generation mobile phone systems and which is directly visible now in the strengthened competitive position with regard to third generation output.


So all these factors must be looked at together.

That is the only way we can make Europe into a true union of diversities.



(Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) President.


Pozac, thats why i asked where can i read

The problem of crime on the Internet cannot be resolved by any state in isolation.
This also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a Parliament would be.
This has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice.
No one would deny that this is an area where countries can gain from mutual collaboration but, of course, there is nothing new about cooperation among our home countries in the asylum field.
It is action not words that is needed.
Affairs and the Internal Market. I would particularly like to express my own gratitude to Mr Langen for his report and for the great clarity with which, in writing and in his presentation today, he has brought to our attention what this is all about.



In the meantime, I am bound by a general regulation, with which you have been familiar since Berlin and which I must apply.
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.

The Commission approves Amendment 2, which expressly mentions the Internet.




It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.
I do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the Budget 2001.



If only half of what is stated in the reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is correct, then the situation regarding the treatment of asylum seekers is indefensible.
I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies.

I am answering on behalf of the Council and not on behalf of the French Government.

2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	as I said, it worked fine before

That has resulted in many of our staff and press officers having to leave on the 12.30 p.m. flight on Thursday.

I am sure that the report will be an important benchmark as we follow the development of the information society.
I should like to thank Commissioner Nielson for his answer and for the efforts being made on behalf of all refugees specifically in the Molucca Islands where the largest group is de facto Christian.





Moreover, the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable, if only for reasons of space and numbers.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.


I do not want to exclude our needing to review how the exceptions are to be worded once we have obtained more information and know exactly what types of plant are concerned.

Well, of course, that fails to take into account the need to address the question of the dangers that may be posed by the dorsal root ganglia and the removal of the vertebral column is specifically directed to that particular point.
Instead, we should continue to carry out a comprehensive case-by-case risk analysis.

At the same time, the Commission also intends defining this balance between the markets and public policy in the context of the Europe Action Plan, which should be presented next week.


I ask the Commission to devote special attention to these two points.
It will then be necessary for Serbia - and for other Balkan countries, too - to be presented with the challenging but realistic prospect of entry into European integration; and presented to each country on the same conditions, without special favours, but for this reason requiring all the more assistance.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
/dev/hda2       /share         vfat    umask=000       0       0
I want an answer to my question.

Indeed, there were repeated and emphatic demands from within this House for progress to be made and for something to be done about all the problems.


The first point is the strategic goal.
However, under the Rules, it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment.
I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia, which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union.
You have presented us with the anti-terrorist agreement drafted by Spain' s Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party.







In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.
It is in no one' s interests to assert that over 10% of people in the new Bundesländer are of a racist disposition, or to disparage them as such.

I could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this, in my view, brilliant journalistic comment.
The fact that 1101 letters of formal notice, 675 reasoned opinions and 123 referrals have been presented to the Court of Justice clearly highlight the difficulties inherent in applying European Community law.

All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.
Fortunately, the Commission has shown initiative in this matter, however, and has focused attention on accelerating developments here.


It has neighbours who are not all very easy and the whole region is more problematic than we may often think.

The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.
The proposed directive, which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan, makes good environmental and economic sense.
I challenge the UKIP to explain to their own supporters how they can be allied to such an obvious supporter of EU over-regulation.

The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.



I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.
For this reason alone, it is important for the Council to follow the European Parliament's lead and not to take refuge in the conciliation procedure, which may allow it to gain time, but not recognition.

Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.
I think we can in fact thank all the Members of Parliament that were involved in this conciliation procedure.
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.
Switching over to a new system at the European Court of Justice will necessitate creating a large number of higher grades, which is something we have no hope of achieving within a year.
I think that this would be an important step towards preventing serious illnesses and premature deaths, especially among particularly vulnerable sectors of the population, including children.
The Council of Transport Ministers needs to take a political decision to address this.

In my opinion, the heavy administrative burden on citizens and businesses, combined with the government' s incapacity to ensure compliance with the tangled web of rules, are reason enough to tackle the simplification of legislation and improvement of its quality head-on.


The directive on inter-Community trade in bovine animals is central to the economic survival of livestock farmers, particularly from my own country, Ireland, where we export up to 90% of our entire livestock production - a very high proportion of which is live exports to continental Europe and beyond.
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.
The European Union has made conflict prevention and the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts a fundamental principle of its international role.



The important thing is to pursue this idea whilst seeking to define its outlines more clearly and whilst thinking about the best method for continuing this exchange of ideas. Like Mr Corbett once again, I feel that we must realise that the term "constitution" may mean the will to speed up European construction and European ambition, but that the term "constitutional" leads, and will inevitably lead, to debate, because it could give rise to, or be nourished and fed by, or include, contents which may turn out to be rather different.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes that plenary at last gradually but properly liberalise the railway market, with liberalisation to be completed by the year 2010.
Lastly, as other Members have reminded us, we must deal with society as well as infrastructures.

There are fifteen people there in military uniform who have taken over one end of the coffee bar and are holding some kind of meeting there.


The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.

Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania.

The truth is that the changes which have been made to the funding allocation plan, particularly in the last year, have not affected the Union' s compliance with its undertakings in these areas. These changes have also been made based on appropriations that remain unspent in certain areas.






How can we make the positions that we adopt here effective?
(The President cut the speaker off)

That really is what the debate is about in this House today.
hold on this might take some time.
pitti: excellent
But you finished up well, 3-2 against England, which, after all, is the most important thing for the people.
In my opinion, it would, on the whole, be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them, although, I must stress, this must be done by taking specific local factors and also the type of aircraft used into consideration.

The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.
Through this and other channels there is a professional dialogue and exchange of views between ECB staff and many outside experts, which is of mutual benefit.
There are two states which still have not ratified the Jordan agreement - no names, as they say, no pack drill - but I very much hope that Belgian and French MEPs - I hope I have not given the game away - will get on to their parliaments to press for ratification as soon as possible.

It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal' s leadership.
I would request the next speakers, if they want to raise a procedural point, to keep it extremely brief, and I would ask the honourable Members to remain as calm as possible.


I was interested to hear Mr Andreasen' s criticism on the budgetary aspect here, but I read in the press that Europe spends EUR 1 billion per annum on helping and encouraging tobacco growers.




(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
In my opinion, it would be appropriate to establish that "young" means those who are young at heart, and therefore give those who are no longer young in years but who are young at heart the opportunity to take advantage of these services.
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.
I therefore hope that this report, as approved in the committee, will be adopted in its unamended form in the plenary tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago the Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously approved the recommendation which is today being considered by Parliament.

and, well, when i installed mldonkey... it got the 2.5-21 version, which is totally broken
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.

Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act. It lasted only five months.
EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended.


Mr President, I am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech.

We know what kind of battles to fight and, with your support, we are also going to win them.
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
Now, let us please endeavour to make good the deficit of the future and give the coming generations a sense of direction, in the knowledge that we are working together, slowly but surely, to achieve something which will last.

According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee, junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period.
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.

I am one of those people who think that a European system of specifications should be introduced, some kind of agency, of course, but which would not necessarily involve privatisation and competition between the various air traffic control centres that exist at the moment.
I should like to say in passing that I would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the Norwegian government, which regularly reminds us by its behaviour on the international stage what we are all missing in the European Union on account of the Norwegian people' s referendum decision.



I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.



In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.
This means that although, in some European countries, the application of this text could in theory improve the situation of asylum seekers, it would make it worse in others.






Furthermore, at the request of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the European Parliament is urgently calling on the Council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners.

As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.
In the light of this, the role of the European Parliament should be upgraded to that of a fully-fledged legislative body and that of a fully-fledged European institution.

thanks bob!!!
Too often our own Member States have been parties to conflict, either through the production and sales of weapons, through the production and distribution of landmines or through the temptation - in the words of a great Victorian statesman in my country - to prefer their wars to be fought at a distance and wherever possible in the name of God.


I must also note that, in terms of bilateral relations, the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey, while at the NATO Summit in Florence, presented a proposal to include a range of good-neighbourly measures on the agenda for negotiations between Greece and Turkey. The aim of these measures will be to consolidate the climate of security and harmonisation between these two countries.

Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings.
I also have a financial interest in telecom and space so I will not participate in the vote.
The European Union welcomes the decision by the Democratic People' s Republic to resume its reporting under the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights during the year 2000 and hopes that the country will now, on the basis of its own report, be able to enter into a useful and constructive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee
This is what some people call stability. Farmers experience it somewhat differently because costs are, of course, rising and price freezes will therefore automatically be experienced as a setback.
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.
There is no need to add to this what I will call the digital divide.
The study carried out under the Grotius programme by An Wergens provides the requisite basic information.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States of the European Union are unanimous in condemning terrorism, whatever the motives of the groups of criminals carrying out terrorist attacks, and so the Council of the European Union is just as firm in its condemnation of all the forms of terrorism carried out on European territory.
We must also look at the case of Japan because it holds lessons for Europe in terms of the organisation of work and the role of the state, of businesses and of the workers themselves in business objectives.


We cannot, however, accept that short-term measures should only be taken at local level.
We invite them to be part of the global economy, so that they can come and sit at the tables in Seattle for the WTO discussions.
Turkey has not acknowledged the genocide in question and is still imposing its economic blockade on Armenia.

Also, although the issue of religion has been excluded from this directive for legal reasons, it is vital to reiterate that we are definitely not ignoring the forms of discrimination based on religious beliefs. Parliament has still to examine another Commission text in this respect.

In considering that issue, you must ask what are the alternatives: vegetable fats, soyas, someone mentioned genetically modified substances.


I say that because he comes from a small political group - and it is often hard to make headway here - and he comes from one of the southern Member States, which will in some ways have to make sacrifices and introduce regulations to bring about effective, proper beef labelling throughout the Community.
International regulations were already in existence, since the Marpol Convention imposes binding international regulations upon all vessels, according to which all discharges at sea are prohibited.
cool Pozac, it works :)


Export refunds are essential to ensure the international competitiveness of non-Annex - I processed food. In addition, the food and drink processors in the EU purchase around two-thirds of all their agricultural produce within the 15 Member States.

A major investigation by five consumer organisations in Europe has recently shown that a large proportion of meat products contains quite large quantities of nitrosamines.
However, the situation on the Moluccas is so critical that we need to treat it as an urgent matter.

Madam President, Point 6, on which we have to vote in this amendment, stipulates a deadline of 15 May.
Within the European Parliament a second computer is being awarded, 20% additional expenses and, as the Court of Auditors was particularly tough on the political groups, a paragraph is included, which, I quote, "Underlines emphatically the increased workload and the particular responsibilities of the political groups."
Mr President, I think it is terribly sad that when we are about to take such important votes some people are trying to obstruct this.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.

We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.


This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.

We need to have them distinguished much more clearly.

First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.
At any rate, this is the first time for years, as Mr Danielsson said, that high level talks have taken place, as they did most recently at Taba, without American officials present, but with Mr Moratinos, our EU peace envoy.
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.
Let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions.
The first session under the trialogue procedure bringing together the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission was held on 6 July, here in Strasbourg, and demonstrated its usefulness in terms of better mutual understanding of our respective positions and priorities.

When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.

We are also agreed that the polluter-pays principle must apply.
Although Parliament cannot take part in negotiations, it has a duty to indicate the way, to define clear options for the future, without pretending to take part in the actual negotiations and without being conditioned by governmental pressure or pressure from artificial comparisons, such as the comparison between large and small countries.


If we forego this practice, then we also forego the subsequent promotion of the European Parliament to colegislator on all future legislative issues requiring a qualified majority.

First, liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross-border traffic, especially freight traffic.



I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.



I believe that if Parliament insists on the adaptation of the annexes to be done by way of codecision rather than comitology, that Parliament will be guilty of not properly looking after the safety of the consumer health in this issue, an issue that Parliament has discussed in this debate earlier today, both in the BSE context and on this particular issue.
We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities.
For example, the liberalisation of investments which is championed covers all sectors of the economy.

The sad thing is that the proponents of racial violence are young people up to the age of 20, most of whom have not completed their education or who do not have a profession.
The way this programme has been implemented is far from ideal - to say the least - and that is why I share and approve of the objectives of the Commission reform. That is also why I support the calls made by Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta to redress the balance, for regional cooperation, for support for 'micro-projects' and for projects involving civil society.
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.

Mr President, you will be chairing the new European Council in the spring, which will be the first Council to deal with general macroeconomic objectives along with employment objectives.

The references to ways of solving the problems of discrimination and to the age range for participation in the programme - 15-25, although there are some exceptions - are also inadequate, given that the average age for completing higher education is very close to the upper limit, which should be raised to 30 years.
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.

I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.

Both reports give the impression of aiming to defend the rights of an indiscriminate individual, who could be living anywhere at all on this planet, rather than the rights of individuals situated in time and space, who have inherited certain traditions, who uphold their own values, i.e. precisely the citizens of our respective countries, who have sent us here to protect them, and for no other purpose.
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.


There are no great differences between them.

The people of Europe do not want this to be a place with standardised consumers living in a large uniform internal market.
Mr President, firstly I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for this excellent and extensive report.
As a member of Parliament's delegation to the Mashreq countries and Gulf States, I am concerned that the association agreements with these countries should be ratified as expeditiously as possible; the Jordanian agreement in particular is only slowly proceeding through the ratification process.
I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also.

As you will be aware, EC subsidies for supplying milk to schools were introduced as early as 1977.
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.

Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.
It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance.

Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.

If we want to settle this issue, we must move towards a universal fee system, which will be mandatory and not linked to the act of waste treatment.
We take the view that these two separate submissions are unnecessary and we have tabled a single proposed amendment which I shall read to you.
In order to justify this strategy of the full liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, the report sings the praises of the supposed positive effects of competition, namely, reduced production costs, increased job opportunities and even goes as far as to praise its positive macroeconomic effects on the job market.



- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.

Furthermore, the messages of the spectrum Green Paper demonstrate the need to address certain radio spectrum issues at Community level and to reach a balance between various user sectors.
We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since?

How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?

The time is now ripe to tackle practicable projects, and practicable projects are those which do not originate from specific preconceptions or concealed motives but from a policy's ability to marry the needs of the citizens with economic and social concerns.
However, the main criticism from both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control concerns the extra bonus which the Bank' s employees received over and above their normal bonus and which substantially exceeded both the maximum levels set and the budgeted costs.

In particular the criminalisation of environmental damage will send a clear warning to those responsible for it.

And we cannot ignore the fact that the only countries which have made any serious headway with the participation of women are the countries which had applied specific policies.
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.
Likewise, it might be worth examining the possibility of rewarding the safest vehicles through the road tax system and demanding minimum safety specifications depending on the type of road, so that road design and construction can be integrated into programmes subsidised by the European Union.

Yes, I am afraid that will delay our work a little, Mrs Frahm.
However, the agenda must tackle the central issues and not skirt around them, as it currently threatens to do.

Mr Sjöstedt, I would say that this matter should be seen from a different angle: that of creating common standards for travel documents, whether they are passports or identity cards.
Ultimately, we are talking about a European Parliament for the 21st century, when we will have to face three fundamental challenges. We will have to respond to the MEPs' new obligations, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, incorporate new technologies into our work and react immediately to the huge administrative, organisational and political obligations presented by enlargement of the European Union.

Firstly, I make a very clear distinction between ends and means.

Everyone is entitled to protection from those seeking political and economic gain from discrimination.
Furthermore, the Commission has been prepared to ignore the principle of relative stability by casually removing from the Community fleet fishing rights that have been acquired in accordance with that principle.



Thirdly, incomplete declarations must be mentioned.
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.

To prevent that discussion also means preventing the integration of the various modes of transport and is therefore no more than lobbying, or a policy of lobbying for the status quo.


We are anxious to see improved air connections to Strasbourg.

You mentioned a matter which has not been raised by anyone. There has been no reference during the debate either to your name or to a list of reprobates.

We cannot deny the Commission the chance to intervene in such highly technical matters.
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.

Every day, thousands upon thousands of elderly people reach retirement age and ask their governments, "Where are our pensions?"

In the future, greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects.

The Security Council must hear this plea.
The firms affected by this measure are those which, on the one hand, provide services of general economic interest in exchange for various different types of compensation, which may be special dues or payments, and, on the other, also perform normal general activities, thereby operating in competition with other firms.

As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.

Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament.
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.
I am an enthusiastic proponent of this report, because it contains and clearly enunciates all the things that are right and important for the preservation of family-owned farms in Europe, without which there can be no support for organic farming with its high-quality regional specialities, which consumers must learn to appreciate and for which they must be prepared to pay a fair price.

As far as the environmental inspections are concerned, the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure that this is regulated effectively.

If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.

Accordingly, I think we should act within the remit of our international responsibility and ensure that we continue to exert the same benevolent influence after the elections that we had in the run-up to them.

In the end, the majority in Parliament agreed to vote in favour of the budget in return for a limited concession from the Council but also, above all, an undertaking from the Council to accept a review of the financial perspective in the year 2000, if the development of the Balkan situation should require resources significantly greater than those for which provision has already been made.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct. I must always be objectively honest.

However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.
That, sir, is all I wished to say, and I repeat, once again, that, by definition, if we want the Wise Men' s report to be truly wise, we must allow them to work wisely, and not try to influence them one way or the other.
In order to appease the multinationals, consumers would have their lives made more complicated as labelling would become more creative and reassuring, small specialist chocolate makers would have to establish a 'quality chocolate' label, cocoa-exporting countries would have to adapt... and you dare to speak to us of a Europe that is close to the citizens, that is generous, transparent and respectful of cultural differences!
There are no two ways about it, education, i.e. training and further education, must take centre stage in all policy areas.

We ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that Parliament be informed of them.


The Commission is able to accept 18 of them.

The colourants concerned are xylidines which may release any of the 21 cancer-causing amines listed in the proposed directive.

If it were up to the British Government - we heard this quite clearly in the negotiations - it could well be 50 years and maybe longer before they resolve this issue.
Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen.


Mr President, waste management is now central to achieving the highest standards of environmental protection.


I can make no other assessment than that, for Sweden, this was a fixed-term derogation which would one day come to an end in favour of current Community directives.
But many of the EU' s social democratic-led governments are visibly unable to take action.

First, something that has already been mentioned here: the deterrent use of European Funds; European Funds must not be given to projects that break Community law.




All this discussion about coordination and about the future of the external service takes place against the backdrop of a treaty which talks about a common foreign and security policy, not a single foreign and security policy in a Union of fifteen Member States, each with its own foreign minister.


Secondly, what method should we adopt? For me and my group the method should be the democratic method employed in all our countries: open debate in Parliament, recorded in full.

The report calls for greater liberalisation of sectors such as the pharmaceutical market and a reduction in the tax burden on employment, thereby proving that the measures being taken are paving the way for greater liberalisation of and less accountable capital transactions and profits with exceptionally dangerous consequences for the entire social protection system.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the great pleasure of welcoming the members of the delegation from the Swiss Federal Assembly, led by their speaker, Mr Marcel Sandoz, now seated in the official gallery.



If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.



Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant, but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU, then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses.

Parliament continues to believe that the visa list in this visa regulation must be definitive, which means that there must be no more exceptions to it, so no black, green, blue, yellow or grey lists, but please just one list, one list which is binding and no other.

And anyone who arouses expectations must be measured by his or her actions, must introduce consistent benchmarking, carry out regular follow-ups, formulate ambitious goals, draft a master plan in every country as to how these goals are to be implemented and, above all, quickly follow words with deeds.


The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor.

The excellent reports by Mrs Malmström, Mrs Ludford and Messrs Haarder and Belder offer us Europeans the opportunity for analysis and, above all, self-criticism.

We must teach our children about all of this.



The subject of closer cooperation has been widely debated and disputed. It used to be known as the 'two speed' Europe and is now referred to as the 'hard core' .



Mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world.
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.

Over the last 50 years, business activity has increased apace, and immigrant workers and sub-contractors are used to a great extent.

This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.

Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.


The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.

- (SV) When the European Parliament today stated its position on the Intergovernmental Conference, I advocated solutions which also provide for the interests of the small Member States.

We shall be voting in favour of a situation in which those who release genetically modified crops into the environment are held fully liable under civil law.

But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting.
A few of these TEN projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe.




The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission' s responsibility, supported by the committees for the relevant programmes.




In France last year there were only 14 complaints and convictions for acts of discrimination.
Whatever the advantages of talking about our visions for the future, right now we have to respond to the aspirations of the men and women who make up Europe, and in order to do so, all the members of the French executive must be involved in order to make a success of this presidency.

These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.
The first is a question of principle.

Mr President, we often use the word 'tragedy' as if we were talking about a natural disaster, such as an earthquake.
The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament, as is the tension over the scope of the IGC.

They have produced a text that is close to the European Commission' s basic proposal which, in my opinion, is on the whole quite satisfactory.

Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.

Mr President, I believe that we all agree that in 2000, obviously, the Community already enjoys numerous and fundamental competencies in the external field.
There has already been reference here tonight to the need for revision.

Obviously, it would be a matter of great concern if someone, whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime, were to be the victim of insufferable treatment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, safety on Europe's roads is a vital matter and the figures speak for themselves: 42 000 deaths a year and 1.7 million people injured. Something has to be done about this.





We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.



It will be a challenge for China and, in due course, for the WTO.

In any event, the rapporteur has, in our judgement, correctly established the bases which will set the course for Section III of the Union' s budget for 2001 and we are happy to offer her our sincere congratulations on her work.
I think this is what we need because, apart from BSE, we also have hysteria and panic to deal with in several areas.


This report sets out a number of proposals for action which are, in my view, to be welcomed.



A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.
So what we are talking about is the period of time between the first promise of funds for a project and a specific contract and the period of time between the commitment and the actual payment of funds.

In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.
I hope this will restore consumer confidence in beef, especially after the BSE crisis.

The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.


In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment, in which, owing to a translation error, there is a wrong word in your copy of the document.


Mr President, the historical issue concerning the French Presidency, for I do feel that it is a historical issue, is first and foremost to open up the way for the construction of a Europe for all Europeans.
for obvious reasons.



Thirdly, the natural environment should be regenerated.

That is why I welcome the fact that a new proposal has now been tabled which extends the first directive.
Finally, I hope that the Commission will tell us what it is intending to do in this area, now that it has an extended legal basis, which includes Article 13 and ex Article 118. This means that it can certainly cover other aspects mentioned in the report.
He simply said "of Greek citizens" , in other words people who are resident in Greece.

I say with some feeling that I very much hope that Member States will take account of what has been said in this Chamber.
There have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed.



Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to Prime Minister Guterres for his account and the clarity of this account.
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?

Madam President, the House kindly agreed on 16 November to a request from the committee which I have the honour to chair to delay the final vote on Mr Cashman's proposed legislative resolution.



In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.
I'm trying to get some sort of nvidia hardware exceleration for my ubuntu imac
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.
I wish to say in response to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s question that refugee status is governed throughout the world by the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.

Thank you very much, Commissioner, for making yourself available.

The present Tunisian regime does not tolerate any independent minds.


The proposed sweeping provisions on family reunification are open to uncontrollable abuse.

A word also needs to be said about implementation of the new DAPHNE Programme following the DAPHNE initiative adopted in 1997.

The various amendments, including those dealing with the Centre' s Management Board, are therefore intended to ensure that the Board uses genuinely effective data-gathering methods which are capable of interpreting the data in the light of unit criteria and provide useful indications regarding the efficiency of the various national anti-drugs policies.

As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members present in the House, Mr Savary' s report is an excellent piece of work and he deserves both thanks and recognition.
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.
Great. :)


The lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society.
It is disgusting that, even in areas where current national and European institutions could actually do something, they do nothing.
Report (A5-0026/2000) by Mr McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States laying down guidelines for a Community Initiative concerning economic and social regeneration of cities and of neighbourhoods in crisis in order to promote sustainable urban development (URBAN) [COM(1999) 477 - C5-0242/1999 - 1999/2177 (COS)]
My third question is: would the instrument you are proposing enable the Council to put an end, by qualified majority decision, to the tax havens which exist within the European Union?
On the other hand, problems relating to land-ownership and other things are very difficult to solve in any country.
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).
For example, the state-owned development bank of Denmark receives 38% of funding while Spain's only receives 23%.


We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations. Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.

Now - during this presidency - is your golden opportunity to take initiatives.
I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council and the honourable Members that we are discussing these issues within Parliament.
Report (A5-0129/2000) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that directive (C5-0183/2000 - 1998/0318(COD))


:-D
I now come to the content of the report.

As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.
NewComer, thnks, i'll try


Here, too, the Commissioner has promised, and the Council has already decided in principle, to help us to put an end to the unfair undercutting of tariffs and prices in the Member States of the European Union - a particularly common practice by the Willi Betz company - in order to arrive at a fairer system in this particular field with regard to labour law and working hours, another area where the railways are disadvantaged compared to the legal and especially the actual circumstances on the roads.
Through the Presidency of the European Parliament, we have sent a questionnaire to Members, in order to find out their specific, individual needs.
The relationship between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights appears, for example, to be legally complicated and could undermine the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mr President, I am happy that the Council is also taking account in this negotiation of the sensitivity of certain regions and certain products, especially in the agricultural sector.



Mr President, the European Parliament' s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries.
pozac: right
An important idea which the Council has adopted from the EP in its common position is to bring forward the date when the labelling regulation comes into effect.

If we look at the study of Gulf War veterans that was done in the United States and compare that with the study of the control group, there is no difference in the death rates, or illness rates, or the rates of cancer between the two groups.


We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.
Although we did not support the amendment aimed at rejecting the Directive, our aim was clearly not to reward those who, in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, had worked on this text for years.

I believe it is a proportionate measure.



In addition, these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community.
Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities.
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.
The Tisza flows into the Danube delta, which is one of the world' s most significant protected areas of environmental interest.


You say that we have to find a solution for those regions which are currently receiving funds, especially the Objective 1 regions. I would like you to be more specific, Commissioner.


Nevertheless, if anything is lacking today, it is symbolic specific action, a strong signal that the Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, are truly interested in this relaunch, which goes beyond words and speeches.



I can understand why the Commission has decided to include the fight against racial discrimination in a separate draft directive.
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.
We are against special provisions being made in specific budget lines as this goes against our common objective, namely, to simplify and unify administrative procedures.

I must stress particularly that the priority objective of this increased coordination should be to reduce structural divergences between the central part of the Union and the peripheral and outermost regions, as specified in one of the amendments adopted by my committee.
Politically, Fiji, which proudly wanted to give its name to the new 20-year partnership agreement between the ACP states and the EU, risks seeing its relations with the international community of states worsen considerably.
However, culture as a means of livelihood is an area which is rapidly growing in importance.
Likewise, if somebody decides to go to another Member State 10 or even 30 years after taking his exams, the citizens and the host Member States want to know what the person has been doing in the last years since his exams.
Finally, the presidency is keen to implement the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean adopted in Feira and ensure that the new MEDA regulation is adopted.

Let me also convey to her my sincere thanks for the work that the French Presidency has been doing in the interests of sport and for the solidarity it has demonstrated with the Commission and with Parliament.
Mr Fischler, I am curious to hear whether you are going to accept the proposals made by the rapporteur - and I should like to thank her for her report.
Our Group would have warmly welcomed that.
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.
We should recall that it is a very good policy of the European Union to encourage students to study in other EU Member States. This affords real and tangible opportunities for students to improve their practical language skills while promoting the free movement of persons across the EU.

A major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment.


At that meeting I raised the point of the European Union' s political responsibility for the Balkan region, and stressed that our entire credibility is at stake.
Needless to say, I will refer this morning' s course of events to the President and the Bureau, upon which the competent parliamentary committee will deal with this matter further.
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.

The fact that the world' s governments refuse to acknowledge that, from the cradle to the grave, girls and women are exploited and persecuted has, throughout the ages, been the most flagrant and far-reaching violation of human rights.
Supporters' clubs and football clubs must be made to take greater responsibility, as it must be said that they sometimes fan the flames.
Being European is a positive thing. It adds to what we already have as national citizens.

But not all of us in this House have been heroes.
We will examine questions to the Commission.

Do we want behave responsibly in respect of developing countries and the Third World in this matter?

I should then like to support Mr Liese who has emphasised that there is nothing wrong with the directive.
And, goodness me, these instructions certainly are necessary!


Let me remind you that the Berlin decision on Agenda 2000 was taken on exactly the same day as the outbreak of war in Kosovo.


EU aid must, as far as possible, be designed to bring about peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.


And that is why I want to state my view here and call on the government, on those responsible in that government, not to hold that referendum, so as not to stir up new hatred, not to reawaken an anti-European mood again - something a party like the Austrian People' s Party, which was always pro-European, is in fact unlikely to want.
Like the rapporteur and other colleagues I recognise that forestry is a very important industry, important for the economy and important for the environment.


Adequate security of any preserved traffic data will have to be ensured.
Belgians are aware of the good and bad sides of regional pride and, as a result, the use of a stadium requires not only the signature of the burgomaster but also that of the Minister of the Interior.
These are the laws of the global community.
However, it must be said that if we feel the Commission could do more, the biggest problem is by far the Member States.

Yet, every year we have the same problem.


This is not just a matter for big business: it is of great concern to little consumers, millions of them throughout the EU who wish for and deserve the right to choose, without having pejorative labelling applied to the product.
We are making major efforts to add lime to lakes and wetlands.




Civil society represents a hope of achieving a civilised society.
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.

However, at bilateral level, we must have the responsibility, the right and the duty to be aware of what we regard as a certain violation of the atmosphere of trust which we can no longer take for granted, because of statements that certain individuals have made in the past and because of the political proposals that these individuals have made.
I think that the outcome of the quorum count is sufficient reason for the Conference of Presidents to revise the agenda for 2001, but at the moment I would like to ask you the following: according to my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, the request for the quorum means that none of the votes can take place.
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.

I am glad to see that this report, which is so important for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe, has been so well written, and I hope that Mr Bushill-Matthews will continue to be a beacon of light for all those drawing up European Union legislative measures on small and medium-sized businesses.
In autumn this year we will have a new opportunity to discuss the priorities of a comprehensive immigration policy of the Union when the Commission presents to the Council and to Parliament a review of the communication of 1994 in order to bring on board the new dynamics, the new social, political and economic realities of the world we live in as far as immigration policy is concerned.

We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.
That is not always the case.



It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro.


We need to learn from our experience with the war in the Balkans, so that a disaster of this kind cannot be repeated.
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.
how is hoary running for you?
The objectives agreed at Barcelona remain fundamentally valid and they are increasingly relevant: working together for peace and stability, creating shared prosperity through establishing free trade, providing the economic and financial assistance to meet the challenges which that implies, and helping to improve mutual understanding and tolerance among peoples of different cultures and different traditions.

where is the sum on the site?
We know that UNICE has, on behalf of the employers, publicly shown its colours in the preparatory documents for the European business summit to be held in Brussels in June: the public authorities are requested to remove all social, regulatory and fiscal barriers to the development of business and to invest massively in shoring up demand.
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse. It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.

sorry
The rapporteur has said that we also need to make certain that safeguards are in place so that there is no intrusion into the privacy of victims.




Madam President, I would like to speak pursuant to Rule 6, in the first instance, and then, if you permit me, to Rule 7(4)(2), but I shall be brief and to the point.


In my opinion some of these deficiencies are linked to structural barriers and precisely this lack of a common strategy within the EU in the area of human rights.
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.



Clearly what matters is internal price stability, and the external value of the euro is of much less significance.






Such an overall solution requires more than the proposed food authority.
I would like us to try to communitise this, but, in the mean time, we must coordinate the energy policy of the Member States.
Typically enough, the Committee on Foreign Affairs outdoes the Commission with its amendments abolishing the EUR 12 million ceiling on each intervention, the Crisis Committee and the nine-month limit on each intervention.
I would also like to tell this House that the concerns voiced here are of course shared by the presidency.
Mr President, the horrific death of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants, discovered by British customs officers at Dover, highlights, above all, the scale of the pressure that migration is exerting on the countries of Europe.
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.
We know that most illegal immigration arrives in Western Europe, as a result of smugglers, particularly in the case of those people coming from far-off destinations such as China.
It seems to me a great idea to rearrange the examination of petitions by themes, to give specialised rapporteurs the task of examining these petitions with greater care, and, where necessary, to draw conclusions which will allow the deficiencies to be corrected, take decisions to resolve possible vacuums in legislative texts, or counteract the unwanted effects of these texts.

I should also like to point out that the Commission has proposed an initiative in which family reunification is seen as a right.
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.
That will make the railways more efficient, reliable and more competitive.
This will determine the success of our work.

For example, funds to help them with training, education, adaptation of premises or the use of new technology.
I listened closely and I would like to thank you for your answer.
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.
Permit me, therefore, to address just a few aspects.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.


These cases have raised and continue to raise, in medical, scientific, military and political circles and consequently in the mind of the public of these countries, justified concern at the possible relationship - which, I emphasise, has not been proved - between exposure to depleted uranium contained in used missiles and the outbreak of the diseases I have just mentioned.
What is needed for a return to normal life in the area is stability, peace and support for economic development.


Of the latter, 8 voted against and 4 abstained.
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.


Other criticism concerned the High Representative' s Office and how the European Union works with that office.


We should be allowed to go there, and we are going to go and have a good fight", instead of watching the wonderful festival of football that it should have been.
It is profoundly unfortunate and offensive that Palestinian school books should contain anti-Semitic statements and describe Israel - the only democracy in the Middle East - in terms as abominable as those of Nazism.
An average of 40% of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments.

If this does not happen, our aid will have the opposite effect.


Mr President, let there be no doubt about it: I endorse most comments made by the rapporteurs and would, as such, like to thank them for the sound work they have carried out.
It is important for us to retain political responsibility on this matter.


Meanwhile, the British Government would like to permit therapeutic cloning of embryos for research.
There are doctors, but there is no medicine.

Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel.

To be honest, ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you to understand that I cannot approve this Article 5 whatever the good intentions behind it.
This morning, in this Chamber, one of the Members made the statement that without rules there is no freedom. But I feel that where there are too many rules, freedom can become confusion.
The Court of Auditors' report noted a lack of any commitments accounting system which had caused great concern; that it was difficult to track project development simply and coherently; and that the ECB had engaged a company of consultants to run some foreign currency reserve subledger projects in July 1998, but by the end of the year the ECB had still not designated a full-time manager for this project, although that was essential for the monitoring of the consultants' work.

guru: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo

I shall now turn to the other points raised in the debate. It has been proposed that payments should be centralised and that all data should be centralised.

Hence the need to accord priority to the monitoring of the different circumstances, with the support of the Transport Intermodality Task Force, with a view to singling out specific lines of action designed to address emerging priorities in individual Member States.





Anyone who does not take action against children and minors being abused and lead astray is jeopardising the future.
To quote briefly from the article, "In its assessment of countries, the Commission will tell France that, like Germany, it must reduce 'fiscal pressure' on labour and reduce the 'administrative burden on companies'."
Mr President, I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gröner for the excellent effort she has made.
Mention must be made of serious incidents which have recently occurred in the occupied territories of Western Sahara, where pro-referendum demonstrations have been suppressed by the Moroccan authorities.
I have to say, Mr Patten, I regret that the Commission does too.
This is not, at this stage, evidence of effective control, but rather of the existence of a profusion of texts which, in the hands of the judges, leave our national assemblies, which are expressing the popular will both legitimately and democratically, under threat of condemnations as well as of penalties.
Anyone had the same problem with that?
There is no dissemination strategy for the results the Board produces and, therefore, only a small proportion of the information produced by the EMCDDA is published and disseminated.
Mr President, thank you for welcoming the members of local government who are the very people who will have to implement what we decide here.


In other words, as I see it, we will still need, in the long run, to implement the separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management.
We are against granting subsidies that encourage excessive industrial fishing, which catches everything indiscriminately, to the point of wiping out species and harming food safety and biodiversity, a fisheries policy which allows fleets to grow out of all proportion, and so forth. Because of this, we consider that untrammelled market forces represent one of the factors leading to such over-investment and that these issues should be taken into consideration in the next round of WTO trade negotiations on liberalisation.

In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.

My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.

When we examine the history of this issue, we realise that the Commission, in making its proposal, has limited itself to a draft review of the Brussels Convention, carried out by a committee of experts before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, i.e. when this was an intergovernmental matter, very close to international public law.

It is simply to administrate the existing resources on each level, instead of hearing this Parliament' s demand that we should create a genuine administrative procedural law for ensuring legal certainty, which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen, that is to say, from the point of view of the people who may have recourse to this infringement procedure.

I would also like to express the Commission' s appreciation of Parliament' s consistently constructive attitude to competition issues, which we consider to be an important tool in the framework of the social market economy to which Mr Karas referred, the ultimate aim of which, as Mr Berenguer Fuster stressed, is to protect the consumer.

As I see it, such an amendment would, in fact, render useless any provision in the field of consumer contracts, notably Article 15 itself. Apart from this, unless I am mistaken, this would leave consumers in a worse situation than that of an operator who is bound by a business-to-business contract, and who would be able to choose between having the case heard in a court in the defendant' s state of domicile and a court in the place where the contract was concluded.

Failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal, exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social, family and multi-functional agricultural model.

The fundamental problems still remain, of course, and they remain intact.
oh sorry, yea gnome-system-tools
That is what the initiative taken with you by Günther Verheugen is about, and we attach great importance to this public debate he will be taking part in, because we are aware of a feeling of disquiet among citizens in all our countries, a need to understand, and a growing sensitivity to the issue of enlargement.

I still remember that it was a major event in my youth to get my own identity card.
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.

As the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on her work, emphasises, it is therefore crucial to adopt bold measures to promote the participation of women in decision-making, which will also require men and women to take on an equal share of responsibilities in public and private life. We must also encourage new anti-discriminatory practices, and that includes within political parties and public and private administrations too, with the aim of eliminating the psychological and practical obstacles to the participation of women in decision-making structures and in political life, thereby preventing retrograde action such as the recent case in Portugal, where the government abolished the Ministry for Equality.

Interinstitutional cooperation should therefore become more vigorous in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more prominent.

Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.

The rapporteur for this report is a member of the Swedish Moderate Party.

So I hope our Parliament will follow the Committee on Agriculture, and the European Commission will feel obliged to make new proposals to us, more in accordance with European interests and our cooperation with the ACP countries.

I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.

Mr President, my reference to Communist dictatorships has clearly triggered feelings of great agitation in an MEP from the extreme left.
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.
Do we really allow excellent individuals such as Mr Patten and Mr Solana to represent us overseas or are we increasingly forcing them to compete against each other owing to inappropriate structures?
In actual fact, this is one of the main points in the directive - that an environmental assessment should be made early on in the decision-making process.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dismayed as I am about the way the 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I particularly welcome the Commission proposal.




The time perhaps has come to specify that only European parties such as these may enjoy public support.
Furthermore, the European Union is just one of five donors involved in its financing.
One of them, relating to cooperation between institutions, is essential to the improvement of the operation of the Committee on Petitions and its capacity for action.

It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.

Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?

This is all needed in order to make sure that fighting poverty remains the central theme when we are actually improving the situation of these poor countries through the enhanced HIPC Initiative.


Since we had to go to conciliation, as Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I would prefer to avoid such procedures as far as possible.
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.
An Arafat, dressed as Che Guevara and greeted as a Saladin: it breaks my heart" .




However, the fact that progress has been slow does not mean that nothing is happening.

Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group is going to vote in favour of your report, but I would ask you, in practical terms, will it be effective enough for us to achieve our shared goal, which is high-level scientific knowledge generating improved performance in every field?
Madam President, I express the view of many MEPs when I say that I regret that we have to deal with this issue in such a short space of time.

We have to bear in mind this very serious limitation when the European Council in December this year receives the first assessment of these action plans.
It is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not create another species of human being in the same way that we appear to be provoking natural and environmental disasters.

Having said this, I also wish to say that we, the Portuguese Presidency of the Union, were greatly concerned to do something, which has never been easy, as you will all be aware, to ensure that Austria participated fully in all of the Union' s work. In addition to this, we were concerned to ensure that Austria' s representatives were treated with the proper respect, including the FPÖ Government representatives to all Council bodies.
I still want to make the very clear distinction - which I urge everyone who has spoken in this debate to note - between the immediate humanitarian short-term response to disaster and the long-term reconstruction work.
It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references, such as Socrates or Leonardo, but in precisely these programmes, we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like.
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.


With regard to Mrs Lambert' s report, I would like to deal with two specific issues.

Had he read the report, he would have found that that is patently untrue.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Newton Dunn on his report and for the ease with which the committee has taken on board all sorts of suggestions.

I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas.

The former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable.

At the same time, the administrative procedures have become more cumbersome with every passing year, yet the personnel running the programme have not seen any increase in their staffing numbers.
Secondly, how much in the way of foreign reserves will the ECB, in practice, spend on buying up kroner in order to support and defend the Danish currency?

The members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Pierre Schori, Anneli Hulthén, Jan Andersson, Maj-Britt Theorin, Göran Färm and Ewa Hedkvist Petersen would like to stress the following points of view in connection with the consideration of Mr Jarzembowski's and Mr Swoboda's draft recommendations for second reading.


The EU is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states.
But it is too late for many small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses and young entrepreneurs.
I believe we must do everything possible to close this digital divide rather than merely declaring (a) that it exists and (b) that we cannot do anything about it.
Like the previous speaker, I want to emphasise that we need to see action taken and that police cooperation needs to be developed and more information made available.
We would certainly prefer to support actual activities than just bricks and mortar, but we are able wholeheartedly to support the intention behind the proposal, and we hope that Mr Galeote Quecedo' s reflections will be given careful consideration in the Member States, the Commission and the Council.

Together with the directive on waste deposition, the directive on waste incineration will put a stop to methods of treating waste which do not take account of future generations' needs and interests.
It would be far better to convert the European Council of Ministers to a kind of Federal Council.

We are in the process of carrying out new studies and as soon as we have the results, we will be more than happy to make them available to you.

2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	fender	i havwe got dvdcss, i played the dvd earlier with ogle.
We must bear in mind the fact that in 1985 certain principles that are today considered to be fundamental were not incorporated, and at that time could not be incorporated into the text of the directive, because debate on the subject had not reached a sufficiently advanced level.
ah i see





Mr President, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, I wish to withdraw Amendments 53 and 55 relating to paragraph 17 of the report.

The importance of this second aspect was, moreover, highlighted by the Commission as early as 1998 when the support strategy for the development of sustainable tourism in developing countries was defined, which stipulated that the problem of child sex tourism should be taken into specific consideration as the subject of structured political dialogue with the countries most affected, particularly at regional level.
The British delegation of Labour MEPs welcomes the action taken by NATO member states to investigate the causes of deaths and illnesses suffered by troops who served in the Balkans.

The purpose of this new text, as with the previous one, but using a different legal formula, is to grant the legitimate authorities of Guinea­Bissau a sum equivalent to the unpaid part of the financial compensation laid down in the agreement currently in force, which totals around EUR 6.5 million and which is intended solely for supporting local fishing activities, for improving monitoring measures and for reconstructing fisheries infrastructure damaged in the intervening period.


To this end, I hope that the Commission will bear in mind the points of view being expressed in the European Parliament.
This is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy.
But all the efforts planned at the present stage, starting of course with the efforts made by both sides, must be geared towards concluding an agreement, an agreement which is, let me repeat, within arm' s reach.

(The President cut the speaker off)


The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.
If voices are raised in Feira, as I hope they will be, to distance themselves from the whole engulfing tide of liberalism and advocate real social and democratic reform, then please, Mr President, open the windows and doors of your summit wide, let that dissent be heard in full transparency and clarity and let a real comparison of options, which is so lacking today, begin everywhere in the full light of day.



What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C' s.


The next item is the Council and Commission statements on terrorism in Spain.

That means, as policymakers and institutions, we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain.
Therefore, solidarity in the fight against organised crime, yes, but please, no specific passage on Montenegro; just support for Montenegro in its struggle for greater freedom.
The question is whether the essential will to commit ourselves exists, because we all know what the possible commitments are: either we wish to make these commitments together or we do not, and my conviction is that there will be the political will and that, therefore, it will be perfectly possible to conclude the work on this during the French Presidency.
Turkey has also been encouraged by recent statements by Mr Verheugen in connection with the role of the Cypriot forces and the way in which G7 is dealing with the Cyprus problem. Under these circumstances, the future of Cyprus should give us serious cause for concern.
Mr Moscovici replied to the question and to Mr Marino's supplementary question and Mr Zacharakis then intervened" .

Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for revising the directive to introduce these exceptions - supposing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise, and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesticide containers in on-farm incinerators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance?
Minced meat involves a much greater bacteriological risk for consumers than larger pieces of beef, so the production date is a very important piece of information.


The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future.

The text adopted in Lisbon by the forum was widely distributed by the Algerian and Portuguese presidencies.
I think that would put an end to tax avoidance and to cheating in frontier regions.
Closer cooperation has the potential to be, under the Union' s rules, a crucial instrument for strengthening integration within an enlarged and more heterogeneous Union.


Similarly, the market does not have adequate resources or adequate ability to ensure that we have sufficiently skilled and trained people.
Our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the British Government.
I do not want lots of debates.

This is, of course, precisely what cohesion policy and regional policy are about.
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.
I would like to raise a few issues from our perspective.
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.
- (PT) Mr President, because of problems stemming from large-scale fraud in the production of wine and other types of fraud, we are more aware that EAGGF Guarantee Section appropriations are frequently used to promote the products of large-scale farming operations whose only real aim is to obtain subsidies, without even considering whether there is a market for these products.

That is why, Madam Vice-President, after a certain party's election victory in a large federal state you would make my evening complete if you were to say: we can accept the rapporteur's Amendment No 3!


??
It was purely a mistake that I voted in favour of that amendment, since any amendments to the Commission proposal were very bad and endanger the whole procedure of getting the safe harbour agreement enforced.

This proposal does not say that all the Member States will be obliged to recognise unmarried partnerships and accept unmarried partners under all circumstances.
The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC.


Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.
In my view, one important point will be not just be to help China integrate into the world economy - it has already more or less done that - but also to help this country take a further step towards the general democratisation of its society.
kergan: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger.html -- this is what I was talking about, wahoo.
Given the government' s poor macroeconomic performance, the EU, like the IMF and the World Bank, has already frozen structural adjustment support.

The recorded aim of the Commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported.
We are gradually gaining an understanding of the positions being adopted by the Commission, particularly with regard to the preliminary draft budget, and the Council will soon state its position.




It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.




Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for firmly quashing the WorldCom-Sprint merger, which was the right thing to do.
I would also appreciate it if we could use this as an opportunity to take a little more interest in our own documents, our own recommendations for decisions, which are equally critical, not least of ourselves, rather than just giving knee-jerk reactions to certain press agencies.
Mr President, the quality of education is high on the political agenda of every Member State, and that comes as no surprise.
The opposite is also true: a closed and secretive administration tends to foster a higher level of corruption.
Dko: you did install gcc, right?


ncpus probed    : 1
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support. We thank you for that.
This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities.



From the relevant debate within committee, it appears that Parliament supports the human rights principles unanimously, which I can only applaud.

The effort to keep our aquifers in the European Union as clean as possible, or as unpolluted as possible, is a key effort if we want to guarantee balanced development, sustainable development and a habitable Europe for future generations.
At the moment, two main schools of thought are discernible.


I believe that you share many of my views, Mrs Reding.



Everyone talks about rail transport, but water transport - where there really is still room for growth - no longer seems to feature at all in the European or national lists of priorities.
marble2, xmms
I believe, therefore, that Europe should adopt some approach other than simply supporting these countries in establishing the free-trade area that Europe was to set up.
Mr Graça Moura, what we need is for non-smokers to respect the rights of smokers and for smokers to respect the rights of non-smokers.

This is already the case in the technical field, in the form of the European Association for Railway Interoperability.



These are, in a nutshell, the motives underlying the opinion issued by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
To conclude, we urgently need a revised Directive 90/220.


Denis Halliday, who resigned his position as Director of the UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirmed the UNICEF statistics that 5 000 to 6 000 children die every month as a direct result of sanctions.
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.
We recently heard statements by Turkish-Cypriots in Cyprus, who have at last come forward and condemned Turkey as an occupying force.
Amendment No 43: people have talked already about the burden of proof.
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.
If either of these amendments is adopted, will you, as President of Parliament, assume full political responsibility for their content and take the consequences if the demands set out in them are not met by the deadlines.

The Commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in Tunisia through the MEDA programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect.

Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.

Article 10 requires Member States to actively cooperate with the Commission in dealing with complaints, to clarify facts and to state official positions.


I am often sceptical about the very large demands, for example with regard to the environment, which are being made of the candidate States.

The Commission should adopt this resolution by the European Parliament.


It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.

Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the political groups in this House who have supported the report of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and who have enriched it through their participation in the intense debates which we have held.

This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.

Given that peat growth is on a year-to-year basis, it is clearly also a renewable energy source.
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.
To achieve a social Europe, let us begin by banning layoffs on the part of firms in profit.
Today, eight years later, two Member States have not yet implemented the system at all or only in part.
As I mentioned, geographical position is the repository or sanctuary, if you prefer, or, in other words, the narrative which enables us to read, understand and hence respect the invariable political factors that are dictated by geography.
never miss burn even with my super cheap CDr




Firstly, what I would call a bespoke liberalisation, a liberalisation that is not untrammelled, that does not go beyond what sensible and reasonable experts think, but is purposeful.

estic cercant els meus pantalons!
We did not want comitology for essential amendments. We are getting codecision.



If that can be done by comitology we will get the kind of speedy response that the consumer requires.
According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease. These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation.
Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement, in spite of his ill-health.

"It is not a case of the population being denied its rights" , according to a Tunisian defender of civil liberties.

I want to encourage the harmonisation of single market measures among all partners - an action programme should be agreed later this year - and to offer diagonal cumulation of origin to those partners who agree free trade among themselves.
European funds must not be tied to national funds.

Subject: Agricultural budget for foreign policy activities in Kosovo With regard to the budgetary forecasts, will agricultural funds be used to foot the bill for Kosovo?


carlos: who knows.
This would mean that children or parents joining members here would have the same rights as EU citizens in the educational, employment and social spheres.

My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in unison that our interests lie in backing the Commission.
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.
Television and film, as cross-border media, attract more interest than radio.



First and foremost, I think it is right that we should now have an actual ban proposed on the use of substances which can produce resistance to antibiotics.


Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal.
And then we will be able to move away from a policy of minorities, the legacy of an individualist thinking that is a threat to a peaceful society, away from an ideology of minorities that is a new expression of the class war, that disregards the profound unity of the human family and seeks to establish superficial divisions based on race, sexual mores, age or ethnicity and demand specific rights for each of them.


I particularly wanted to congratulate President Prodi on emphasising the issue of governance in the overall planning process.
Well then, I do not feel that the situation is so bad. Rather, I suspect that the European Union is taking political action against not just Tunisia but also the Balkan countries, for example, in deciding to provide greater or lesser financial incentives for the countries depending on the internal policy adjustments which the countries can guarantee.

Technical solutions cannot be found unless the negotiators are firmly resolved to reach agreement.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I am of course especially conscious of the point you have made about the Union' s smaller Member States.
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.
Local communities and local governments play a key role in solving the problems of the Roma.


Secondly, I should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work.


The European Union has started actively preparing for the event.

The obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment at an extremely early stage of town and country planning activities does, in fact, make it possible to incorporate environmental concerns fully right from the conception of town and country planning plans and programmes.



That is hard to say, as there is not really a European asylum policy to speak of.
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.


Zimbabwe does, of course, still have considerable problems, but the European countries and the Union will continue to assume their responsibilities as partners of Zimbabwe in jointly tackling the problems of poverty, ill health and under-development.
Despite confusing, and often conflicting information, it is gradually dawning on us that there is a risk of a power vacuum developing in Kinshasa.

not for IM
Excuses and promises are no use.


This indicates that we have a broad consensus.
How viable is the European industry if it is confined to the European boundaries and to those bilateral agreements?
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.
a vcd does not contain mpeg-4
At the same time, I call on the Member States to honour their obligations to transpose and control legislation and report to the Commission properly.




If you want to know who elected this party which forms part of the coalition, namely the Freedom Party, then the answer is that 50% of the workers who used to vote for Socialism have now voted for this party and that half the youth of Austria voted for this party.
2005-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	speel	thats it?
Once again may I stress that the reputation of Mr Schori and the role that he played were key factors in our judgment for the success of the mission.


Experiments on animals have shown the toxic and carcinogenic nature of some phthalates, which can cause liver, kidney and testicular ailments in children that suck or chew on dummies, rattles or teething rings.
hey... I've done apt-get install nvidia-settings linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1-3-686     What do I need to do to setup nvida on this laptop?   ( nVidia GeForce2 Go chipset )

This is true of old countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal but is also true of relatively new countries such as Poland, Italy, Germany and Romania or of very new ones, including the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Lithuania.
Consequently, these tests, which produce results within a relatively short period of time, will most certainly help us to take immediate and appropriate action.


I shall fight for clear rules within the framework of the financial regulation.
Mr Kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the Parliament discharge.
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.

Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies.


For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.


At the same time, however, we are, as a result, standing on the threshold of new tasks that are at least as important.
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.
The University of Edinburgh have indicated their willingness to cooperate with any suitable modification of the patent.
I should therefore like to reiterate the Commission' s commitment to promoting more effective European action against terrorism, using all the means made available to it under the treaties, whether these terrorist acts take place in Spain or in any other Member State, as I have just been informed has happened tonight in the United Kingdom.

The supporters of that theory should get their act together.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this long road, aware of the realities, I think the time has come to leave hypocrisy behind and not to continue to ignore the most important obstacles, including the Kurdish problem.


On the one hand we have economic efficiency, since, in this new technological context, the quality of human resources is essential.


Above all, I am going to highlight one more, and that is that it opens up the road to seriously dealing with the need to fully enter into this pioneer territory.
This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle.
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.
I think they are in the House and will arrive in time.

They are trying to explain, for example, to the United States the full scale of what Europe is doing in the Balkans.


Mr President, we find ourselves gazing with bewilderment at each new act by the Milosevic regime, acts against its own people.

in xchat, what are those two bars below the member list for?





One of these, for example, would be to have a total budget allowance, similar to the system we set up for Ireland and other regions, to cover phasing out and a transitional period, particularly for those regions which were closest to the average.
It accepts Amendments 5 and 6 in principle and Amendments 2 and 3 in full.
We voted in favour of this disputed clause in the Karamanou report even though we are convinced that quotas are no solution, far from it, to the inequalities which women suffer both in decision-making positions and, much more, in society in general.
I believe, although it is not my party's government, that the British Government has been measured and considered in its response.
But in order to do this, a number of conditions do need to be met.
Particular importance should be attached to forests in the Mediterranean and the Balkans which previously supported numerous communities and which are now in danger of disappearing.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is still reason to be hopeful that we may either reach a definitive agreement - a faint hope, to be honest, since there is little chance of reaching a definitive agreement by Sunday - or that we may gain an explicit commitment from both sides on a range of parameters so that, whatever the situation in Israel and the territories after 6 February, there will always be a range of commitments that have been agreed on, accepted by both sides, which means that we will not have to start the next negotiations practically from scratch.
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is a mistake, or if it is not a mistake, it is some mischievous prank by the dirty tricks department of the Liberal Party.
not really all the other distributions I tried had ther sth like normal user
The Commission also intends to propose measures concerning persons with special needs in its proposal for a directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers, which will be presented in the first quarter of this year.
Mr President, this is a most useful report on a very important issue.

The report indicates that the large sums of money which need to be invested in order to develop the infrastructure will come from public funds, whereas the way in which the infrastructure is used will be governed primarily by the requirements for profitability and competitiveness of the private companies that, according to the proposal, should be its main users.
although sometimes external observers may be less biased; it depends

I see no reason not to proceed to a vote.

Mr Purvis, as I have already said, we have not waited for the signing of the Agreement to indicate to the Egyptian authorities, when appropriate, our disapproval of any kind of conduct which does not respect fundamental rights.
Ribs: supposedly the ubuntu developers use it as a server

In that context particular importance is attached to clearing the land of mines, a point which my honourable friend referred to, rebuilding farming systems, supporting secure livelihoods and embracing key health and education challenges.

These are the buzzwords now in the European Union.
Firstly the Commission has failed to deal with the issue of the 12 to 14 million third-country nationals living legally in the Union who currently suffer discrimination and, outside the Union's island States can move freely de facto but cannot do so legally, which of course creates situations in which they are exploited and used in illegal ways.

The key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established.

The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on creating a monitoring centre for industrial change.
I think that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, should direct his team forcefully here in order to take transparency in Europe a stage further.

Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.
The European Council in Helsinki did what it was entitled to do and passed a resolution which, when it was passed in Helsinki, incorporated certain expectations of the Turkish side and here the European Parliament is in agreement with the European Council.
Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless.



Many of these solutions are perfectly rational and obvious and, occasionally, ideological such as restrictions on vehicles or the eco-tax but, as you reminded us, none of these is a panacea that will in itself sort out the situation.
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.
Certification systems will guarantee that consumer choice is in direct relation to the pricing of electricity.
Consequently the answer is not 'no' , but it is not entirely 'yes' either.


What we are doing forms no part of it.
B5-0282/2000 by Mr Buttiglione on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
In your work with the governments of the Member States, have you noticed any commitment to harmonising our points of view?
The European Union has issued two statements condemning the RUF' s violations of the peace agreement and the abductions of UN peace-keeping personnel.



In conclusion, I strongly believe that the new directive on cross-border transfers is good news for the consumers of the Union. It is also good news for financial institutions.

If the Commission refuses to render account, our response can only be to refuse the discharge.
Specific instruments, such as interest rates and the exchange rate, are no longer at our disposal.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)


We spend almost DEM 100 billion of our petty cash on agriculture every year.


The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the directive will stimulate European integration and will, consequently, lead to greater economic growth, more investments in innovation and more jobs in Europe.

We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.

Hi all, anyone use the ati drivers?


Of course, the current state of the world and the intricacies of the international system also raise other issues and questions which, in my view, form an integral part of the issues and problems which need to inform a specific proposal on European foreign policy.

How will the system actually be configured?

There has been a genuine revolution in commercial, social and personal relations which have a real effect on the daily lives of citizens: health, advertising, banking transactions, or even aspects which relate to the security and defence of citizens, and of States themselves, can be jeopardised if there are no rules to guarantee the correct transmission and storage of the data which today circulate with total freedom and which are not immune to the serious danger of indiscriminate use.
That report must therefore correspond to the expectations of those in the surrounding area.




The people will put up increasingly stubborn resistance to transport violations of their environment.
Beyond the Intergovernmental Conference, we are also awaiting a review of the working methods and organisation of the European Union' s institutions.


The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.
What action are you going to take?
He should be quite clear about that procedure within our Group.
This is clearly what Spain is doing and is also what the Commission is committed to doing in the fields in which it has competence.

The next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women.
We must now join forces and urge the national governments to make a success of Nice.
Mr President, the President of the Commission will not be surprised if I speak to him about the internal market.
The consequences for European aviation are not hard to imagine.



Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.
It is therefore a horrible irony that the United States is one of the few countries in the developed world which still retains and practises the use of the death penalty.



Millions of people are again threatened with starvation.



Ordinary, regular contacts cannot work miracles. They will not bring about marvellous new results, but they are necessary.

I in turn wish to assure the inhabitants of Malaga and Mr Carpena' s widow of the European Union' s intention to fight on their behalf against the scourge of terrorism, which represents a real threat to our democracies.
With the conciliation we have achieved, we have taken a welcome step in that direction.
You cannot abolish risk because it is part of our natural environment.

The purpose of the strategy is to equip Turkey for entering into negotiations.
In order to draw up an accurate picture of the terrorism situation within the European Union, and this is the second priority of our presidency, we wished to continue the practice of providing an opportunity at each meeting of the working group of exchanging information on recent developments in terrorism in each of the States.
If their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right, why limit this to the local and European levels?
(SV) Of course, it is important for the respective Member States to make a list of the existing industrial land that is polluted and the best way to tackle this problem.
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.
I am saying this as a regular visitor to De Kuip Stadium and I know that there is space for disabled supporters at De Kuip, but not for an unlimited number. Did these handicapped supporters not want to be filmed or were they not allowed to be filmed?

I should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break-down which is provided there which, I must confess, is not my own work.
Any student who wants to understand conciliation procedure or codecision procedure has a nice straightforward case study here.

kergan how did you do that?

But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.


I believe that what is now proposed with this 'Charter' will eventually lead to conflict between the interpretation of rights under the different documents, which could create a legal vacuum and, ironically, reduce the rights available.
But this right was always in danger of being changed, restricted or abolished.






sivang: yes

Of course, the infrastructure must be safe and must be a matter for the authorities, but operators cannot achieve a lawless and fiercely competitive market without the risk of bottlenecks or a serious accident which would compromise everything that has been done.


Mr President, the basic economic instrument for the implementation of our Mediterranean policy, resulting from the Barcelona Process, is undoubtedly the MEDA programme, on whose activities it is my task to report, and for which my fellow Member, Mr Valdivielso de Cué and I are currently involved in amending the regulations.

I am delighted that a situation has arisen in the meantime in which the partners have had it pointed out to them once again that they still have the chance to enter into consultation or reach agreements.



I was very excited when I read the Commission' s proposal.

Cover-ups or even sweeping issues under the carpet are not the answer.

While the persistence of discrimination between men and women, with regard to pay for example, is unacceptable, to set men against women, as some feminist organisations do, would be sterile and put social cohesion at risk.
The eight other Member States - Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - ban vegetable fats.
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	LostMonk	ok
It is a political fight, in which our role, is it not, is to wage this campaign, even if it does lead use to make ambitious political decisions which occasionally go further than those of our own governments, and which are always far-reaching and positive?



There is also a second reason as to why we oppose the Council' s proposal.
We still do not have any right of codetermination in agriculture, which is why our only option is to refer this report back to committee and I urge the House to vote in favour of my motion.
As has been pointed out, President Pastrana appeared before this House and offered to make a substantial effort to bring all the parties to dialogue.

Turkey must at last abolish the death penalty, the only country in Europe yet to do so.
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .
wood1, Dont known.. have your admin open up the port
A special culling regulation for animals over thirty months old has also been introduced.
It is very clear that if a report has come from a committee, the committee can request referral back.
I do not blame the staff of the SCR who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them.

I did find it to be rather limited, on the basis of a desk study, but in view of the considerable interest in Europe there is every reason to continue the regulation.

The words of the English text, which I understand to be the basic text, are: "asked the Council presidency".


That deserves the headlines in the press but, as you know, the fight for jobs is already taken for granted.
This is the sole objective of the regulation, which is an instrument pursuant to the Dublin Convention and which goes no further than that objective.
Mr President, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe and the very good report on it by Mrs Peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally-friendly mode of transport in Europe over the past two years.
They know all too well what Saddam' s pledges are really worth.



The deceptive salve of a purely economic recovery would soon wear off, overtaken by the gangrene of spasms in the environmental arena, and thus the health arena, and ultimately, the social arena.
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.
It must, in the first place, be based on the Treaty articles relating to both the internal market and the environment.
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.



Industry is still underdeveloped and unevenly distributed regionally.
The army plays a dubious role.


Mr President, I would firstly like to wish the Swedish Presidency of the European Union luck.
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.
The proposal is nonetheless a clear expression of the political will that exists to attain the long-term objectives in the directive, too.

I am able to tell you that the Commission shares Parliament' s view on these points.
I have also offered the Spanish authorities our support.
Yes, the Commission needs to recruit a different sort of personnel.
I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution, the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced.


We must also question the actions of the European Union and its ability to pursue this initiative in favour of the international moratorium alongside the United Nations and the international community.
The nuclear power station in Temelin is being commissioned earlier than was agreed or was expected, and it is not intended to carry out the environmental impact assessment until some time after the fuel elements have been installed, making it a pointless exercise.


As this amendment was not retained by the Council, the consumer will not be correctly informed.
We are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of Fridays.

There are social fundamental rights which, by their very nature, are identical to and, as such, simply form part of, the traditional civil freedom rights.
xmms kicks ass
how can i make sure it just tries reiserfs upfront

Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France' s requests. I am pleased to hear it.
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.
If you look at the Haug report, Parliament wants to find a solution.
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.



The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to.

If Iran claims to respect human rights, trials like this should never be allowed to happen.
This is, in fact, the first text in the world to offer a satisfactory solution to the problems involved in patent protection and bio-technological inventions and, what is more, the first text in the world to win universal approval.
We must make one thing crystal clear once and for all: our criticism has never been aimed at the people of Serbia, but against those in power who are abusing the name of the Serbian people for their own criminal ends.
These declarations of intent are more than anything motivated, I fear, by the determination to establish a European sovereignty on the pretext of protecting the Community budget, which, I must remind you, is made up of contributions from our Member States.
I believe there are no age limits for this type of illness.



Mr President, it says "BUDG 1998 discharge" on the notice board, but it should say CONT.

We must ensure - and Mr Patten has the right approach in proposing the reorganisation of external assistance - that we strengthen the power to act of our Community bodies, and that we improve the way in which work is carried out there and make it more effective.
Nowhere else on the EU' s external borders is such cheap alcohol available than in those regions that border onto Finland.
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.


Specifically, I think that Amendment No 6, tabled by Mrs Thomas-Mauro, which requests that border controls be established at internal borders, is extremely dangerous.

We will have to have recourse to different acts, environmental taxes, charges and administrative measures, for example regulation of departure and arrival times, taking account of the fact that rail traffic exists alongside air traffic in areas where long distances are not a hindrance, and that must be developed.

AndyFit1, did you move the file or something?

These are the considerations with regard to the proposal.
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.
This calls for hard and fast objectives, but we are aware that these will not be attainable unless we base our proposals on genuine social dialogue, and I feel that we must also move forward in this respect.

The Bureau has also noted that there is a problem with the sound, but this problem can, of course, only be fixed when we are not working.
Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though.


2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks: hum ?
nope that was a cake walk
But the actual objective is clear.
That is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda.

So we want supplementary analyses taken into account, we want firmer commitments, we want a specific point about strengthening employment and social cohesion in the information society - because there is nothing about that in the Commission' s communication - and we want a strategy with guidelines, recommendations and indicators.

Nothing is more important than this.
You should know, ladies and gentlemen, that making Europe tasteless will not contribute to its popularity.



Retroactive legislation affects competition and is unacceptable from a legal point of view.
We particularly support the fact that it is not the Office of the High Representative which is calling the shots; it is the European Union which coughs up the funds and which will have to check whether these are well spent.
Mr President, could I first of all convey my thanks and compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this matter.

B5-0259/2000 by Mr Procacci, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the fight against organised crime in South-East Europe;
The situation in Ireland is quite contrary to this principle.
One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed.
When we come to framing the resolutions, we will all remember your suggestion and bear it in mind.

Moreover, the mechanisms which we are implementing to link Member States who are in NATO with those who are not and, at the same time, the formulas which we are using to link the European Union in terms of security and defence with NATO partners outside the EU seem to have found the right balance. We hope that the Feira European Council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area.
why fedora then? oO

The Liberals do not, however, support the idea of setting up a new institution in the form of an EC College of Diplomacy. Nor do we want the present delegations to develop into EU embassies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
So you see the strong Finnish theme in this report continues even with me.



It would be a real aberration if in the new European Union area of freedom, security and justice the law served precisely to support those who committed such a despicable crime.

That is why I cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 27 to 30 and 35.


Second report (A5-0176/2000) by Mr Gerhard Schmid, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment (SN 3040/2000 - C5-0265/2000 - 1999/0190(CNS))

I do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it.
All this requires a commitment from all the operators involved and the political impetus to introduce the necessary measures, but in our turn we must convert this political will, ladies and gentlemen, when the time comes, into priority expenditure, both by the Union and by the Member States.
thanks guys i appreciate ur helps..am gonna try this sane cvs...it support my scanner..
This is causing very serious and justified alarm, due to a serious breakdown in the nuclear reactor, and because, among other things, European Union directives are not being complied with.




To refer briefly to the sectors or groups in which undeclared work has the most scope for expansion, we need to include multi-job situations where the income obtained from this illegal work is supplementary; economically inactive people who have greater flexibility in terms of time and the case of the unemployed who want an additional income, often turning down offers of legal work.


Aside from the rightful decision by the President to send her condolences to the families of the victims, perhaps, Mr President, it would be helpful if that communication from the President urged all the authorities responsible for transport in the European Union once again to step up the application of legislation and the monitoring of safety conditions for the transport of both school children and pensioners, who have frequently been victims of such tragedies.
The charging policies that we are going to present will support the competitiveness of intermodal transport.
If there is any way that we in Parliament and my group can assist, we are ready to try to do so.
I would like to thank those Members of this House who, in turn, have thanked the Commission for the work it has done.
Firstly, not just the mere fact that one of the candidates decided not to stand in the second round of the elections, but rather that that candidate was Alejandro Toledo, who is supported by all the opposition, and who in free elections would stand an extremely good chance of toppling Fujimori.
ChrisH: sure.. it will have to be super quick
The question which concerns us today, more than anything is: what should this charter contain and what legal force should it have?

The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police.


Therefore, if it is not possible to obtain an immediate ban, it is essential to impose an immediate moratorium, for although these shells are not currently in use in war they continue to be used in exercises.
I believe that this Commission is very open to taking on board some - I hope all - of Parliament' s concerns and criticisms, because we have criticisms too.

We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year.


Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.

Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?


The extension of the PACT programme, pilot actions in combined transport, will also spur matters on.
It is, for example, very important that accurate information is available concerning their sources of income, and the financing of elections is of particular importance in this respect, since money must not determine success in elections.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very positive Thursday for the European regions in general and for the outermost regions in particular, since this Parliament is dealing with reports as thought-provoking and important as those of Mr Turco and Mr Ripoll, which refer to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund respectively, as well as the assessment of the transparency of their implementation.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)

I often imagine that when the Ministers for Finance see one of us, a citizen - many of which are pensioners - drinking wine, whisky, vodka or any sort of alcohol, they say "Goody goody!
Free elections have been held. There is freedom of the press, and the office of president was in a peaceful and orderly state when the country' s great reconciler and nation builder, Nelson Mandela, left it.


I do not believe anybody can deny that family reunification is also an important instrument for the integration of immigrants from third countries into their host societies.

I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.

2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	then it says ""localhost dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received
It works against Parliament because it excludes us, because there is no longer a comitology procedure, and because we will no longer have access or entitlement to the information we need.



my cd burner didnt work, my HD was connected wrong and lots of shit
But I understand that perhaps Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf may very well have misinterpreted the comitology and that he intends to amend it again during this plenary.
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.
Is it not about time we commissioned an independent inquiry into the decision-making process for building projects?


:)

There is also the misconception that Member States will somehow foot this bill and make up the deficit on the basis that it is their responsibility to deal with health and social policy.
(SV) This is a very important question.

At the same time, the involvement of both sides of industry must be continually intensified.
What do we want, what objectives do we want to achieve or support with this budget?
i check it out
The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue.

Firstly, we must safeguard the future of the dual system of public and private television, and it is essential that European public operators can make full use of the possibilities offered by the new information technologies.
The EU is in close contact with the United States, which was last year' s proposer.

anir: so in large part, we cannot use these things easily on linux
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have had.
Therefore, bearing in mind that the rapporteur has not spoken on this fundamental issue, I understand that the amendment still makes sense and the Group of the Party of European Socialists accepts it.
That is why it is so important that we take up the battle here against money laundering and prevent it from happening.
He claimed that his report had been on this morning's agenda.




Mrs Lalumière' s report is excellent, particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations. The report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here.
This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation.
Mr President, our group, as you know, did not vote for the Sjöstedt report in committee.






martin_, it's ok, hang in there :)

We are defending the concept of authentic chocolate.

He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.

So, unless we are seeking, once again, to renationalise the common agricultural policy on the quiet, there could be no question of accepting this proposal.


This is a very good idea.
Management at this level allows for a high degree of coordination and exchange of best practice between those involved.


These are not reliable sources of information and are not available simultaneously to all Members in all languages.
This is particularly true in the case of the competition rules, which do not derogate from the framework established by the Euratom Treaty regarding Community nuclear research.





Liberalism may well be worthwhile, but only gradually, in small doses, without definitively ruling out state interventionism, lest we tomorrow suffer the financial consequences of giving it up!
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.

In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.




She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.

Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to the remarks that have just been made.
Our young people are Europe's future.

At the moment, it is a hugely politically-charged issue.
The European Union's initiative must include financial assistance, for genuine, stable peace processes need assistance if they are to evolve into stable democracies.
Lastly, my third reason is that the Union' s regional policy, which accounts for the Union' s second largest budget, is meaningless without an effective planning policy.


I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.

In my opinion, you do not get something for nothing. Their cooperation in these activities should also be outlined.
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?

"Mr President, which weapons shall we use against Milosevic?"


Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.


What often happens nowadays is that attempts are made to identify and repair damage once it has occurred.

An important European value that we all, whether lay or religious, purport to share is that any experimentation on a human being should only be for their exclusive and direct benefit.
The intention to work in close cooperation with the new American Bush administration within this diplomatic minefield deserves the support of the European Parliament.
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.

, Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control. (DE) Mr President, it is amazing that the follow-up report on the discharge seems to be generating far more interest this time than the discharge itself, which was, in fact, prepared by the previous Parliament.


We have partners in the ACP Group who are part of the process of convincing and putting pressure on Fiji to do the right thing.

That, Commissioner, is what I wished to say.
It should not be divided into two or contain a whole lot of references.


It is one thing to prescribe sound environmental standards but quite another to comply with these.
It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s two proposals on these two fisheries agreements, particularly the agreement with Guinea.
is that what they write windows in?
They, too, are the victims of a policy whose main victim is the people of Sierra Leone.
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.
Madam President, can I impose on your goodwill and Parliament's goodwill for a moment in welcoming to the diplomatic gallery a delegation from Kazakhstan?


So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.






The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.
That is important because young people are enthusiastic about the European ideal and we do not want to put anything in their way that makes them think that Europe is not welcoming and not moving in the right direction.

There are no problems there of the kind he describes.
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.
in that case i will provide them for you.. no big deal for that
As regards the manner in which Article 151(4) of the Treaty has been applied, I shall simply respond by saying that respect for and furtherance of the diversity of the cultures of Europe remain at the heart of the entire Community structure.
but didn't see it :(
As Mrs Peijs' report outlined, these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and, in essence, what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts, but not their own winding-up proceedings law.


Descriptions such as 'veal' or 'beef' are sufficient, and anyone who wants more information should also be able to obtain it.
There is, in itself, nothing wrong with emphasising the core functions, and I applaud the fact that the Commission would like to assume a better, more prominent role in order to develop policy ideas and political initiatives.

Naturally, we are all seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides.
We did not come to the aid of the Kosovo Albanians so that they could make the life of minorities in Kosovo hell.




Parliament notes that due to the variations in its implementations, the current regime has led to legal uncertainty in different Member States.

Which is why I believe that this regulation is a good regulation.

Mr Elles, first of all, I am going to suggest that we enter Zimbabwe as the fifth sub-item in the 'Human Rights' section, since I believe that is in line with what we have just agreed.
We also have to reach agreement with management and labour, for example, on the subject of remote working and vocational training, if what we are talking about is an information society for all.
We feel that opinion is also divided over the form that the Union' s institutions should take after enlargement. There would appear to be a choice between developing the supranational components - strengthening the role of Parliament and the Commission - and enhancing the intergovernmental aspects.
Our Ministers had stressed the importance of encouraging milk consumption because of its high nutritional value, especially for children and young people.

When one condemns the fantasy or the rhetoric of zero immigration, one does so in order to suggest that there is an alternative, and the alternative is to have a proactive immigration policy, which puts at the top of the list of common concerns the integration of legal immigrants into the societies that receive them. One condemns it in order to clarify the criteria and the principles of a coordinated immigration policy at European level.


Mr President, I shall also be voting for this resolution, which I consider to be reasonable.






On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.




Mr President, I should just like to say in reply to Mr van den Berg that the report on postponing discharge for the Structural Funds is ready and the vote will be taken on the premise that this is indeed merely a postponement and does not grant or refuse discharge and that everything which we worked on together yesterday will be taken into account in the final version, i.e. that we shall nonetheless debate and vote on Mrs Rühle' s report.
They commissioned air analyses from the German company, Dekra, which identified certain failures which we have remedied as quickly as possible.

I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.

Mr Hänsch, we shall deal with this point when we come to the draft agenda in a few moments, and we shall make a decision at that time as to how to handle the situation.
Mr President, I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics.


This can only get worse after enlargement, because the current Member States are setting the wrong example.


Different means, and our assessment of them, change over time.






Pozac, I can't figure out, ipconfig eth1 192.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ? then I need to forward ipv4 ?
If the fight continues, human rights continue to be violated and parties fail to get involved, there can be no talk of fully resuming European aid.
Since the way to accession was reopened in Helsinki, nobody has been able to say where this newly-cleared path will lead, nor how long it will take to reach the end.
The European Council expressed strong support for what we are doing.


She gives one excuse after another.
We have Europol, and other institutions like this, where different agencies in different Member States working together can achieve results.
For that reason, I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by my colleagues, Mrs Schierhuber and Mr Rübig, that the Directorate-General on Agriculture should be responsible for forestry.

The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we, and our citizens, have no protection at present.
On the other hand, as you know, on 21 December 1999, the Council sent Parliament the strategy document on organised crime drawn up under the Finnish Presidency, expressly specifying that it wished to keep Parliament informed right from the start of discussions on this document.
But back to Europe. In my opinion, it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education.


We therefore think that the Commission' s proposal for a total overall budget of EUR 400 million over the five years is both realistic and appropriate.


I gave you some leeway as you are such a distinguished Member of the House but I must cut you off there.

A proposal of this type brings us back into line with the thinking adopted for the Special Summit on employment which is to take place in Lisbon in March.
There are going to be difficult moments, without doubt, after the elections; there will be uncertainties and we will need to continue to have - as we Europeans have always had - the determination to continue supporting this peace process.
scoon: me too



I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building.
hm
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the association agreement between the European Union and Tunisia has been in force since 1 March 1998.


But we cannot keep in touch with what is happening.
In this sense, I clearly endorse the PPE' s stance and would strongly urge this House to show great concern, and great willingness to provide support, but via Wahid, and also prescribe requirements to be met, again via him, because we need to play the game through him for the time being.
Feira should approve this plan and I want to underline two key factors in the programme presented by Erkki Liikanen: first the reform of the regulatory environment for communications and electronic commerce, then, access for all citizens, especially young people, to the resources and qualifications needed in the communication and information age.

We are opposed to increasing the amounts proposed by the Commission, as recommended by the rapporteur.
On the contrary, it is a guarantee of human rights.





Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.
We have a backlog of projects to complete and we have underspent the human rights budget in the past so I would find it very difficult to justify an increase in spending until we have sorted this out.

Rewop, hoary will be released in april

fresh today

The President of France, Mr Jacques Chirac, has written to President Prodi on this question.
All production ought to be stopped, and all stockpiles destroyed.
This is what the Edinburgh research is about.
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.
Mr President, I also commend Mr Parish for his hard work and the excellent report.
As we know, we have been discussing the issue for years.
That is due not least to the dissension within the Union.


The Patent office has acknowledged a 'linguistic' mistake which does not seem to be entirely corroborated by Article 11 of the description of the intervention.
The first one is noise, which I have dealt with extensively, and the second one is the CO2 or the greenhouse problem.

And as long as the scientists are still arguing, as long as all of us do not know which of the scientists is correct, we must agree that this ammunition cannot be used until every last aspect of the issue has been resolved.
In particular, I want to state that, outside this debate on the legal instruments - police cooperation, legal cooperation, the questions of how to make the extradition system more effective and how to ensure a European mandate for investigation, which we are looking into - there is an added value which Europe is providing in the fight for freedom and democracy.

i have too see in " where to get other legally  questionable package" ..bob2 scizzo
It is a very practical document.
It is time to implement the decisions about quality labelling and, in cooperation with the service providers, to devise practical codes of conduct without thereby raising the cost levels for consumers or introducing costly bureaucracy.
One of the strengths of the European film industry also accounts for its structural weakness.
I would like to stress that the Arusha Agreement does not represent the end of the war, for peace has not yet been established, but the agreement does exist and requires an immediate initiative from the European Union.

add*

The question of access to information in order to be able to carry out the discharge procedure with the required degree of seriousness and with the documents which you need for the discharge process was central to various interventions.
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset - whose acquaintance I made during a visit to Israel a very short while ago - and the representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.
We need Europe-wide cooperation and encouragement in all areas of education.

This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.



In July we will have already drawn up the directives for undertaking these negotiations.
We therefore support all Mr Ferber' s amendments.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)


What was disappointing was the water price policy.
That is why we need a White Paper on transport policy which seeks to readjust modes of transport, to improve the Trans-European Networks, to eliminate points of congestion, to promote the railways, river transport, short haul sea shipping, to promote effective and less polluting urban transport, with the rationalisation of the use of the traditional car and the promotion of innovative research projects into clean fuels, and to improve the awareness and education of drivers.
Many thanks, therefore, to the rapporteur and the European Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will improve its work in this area.

In actual fact we have already discussed this and Parliament has always been opposed to it.


They amount to only 0.08% of Community GDP in the year 2010.
?

I am against the commercialisation of culture.
Industry is all too aware of the importance of the Community competition policy for its operations, but let us also not forget that fair, enforceable and sound competition rules also affect the consumer.


We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.
This technical development offers the consumer still greater opportunities for using audio-visual products, in terms of time, place, content and equipment.
I would just like to mention the example of the Studio B operators who, in addition to being pressurised by heavy fines from the authorities, saw their equipment destroyed by hired masked vandals.


It is not, however, my fault, Commissioner, if there is a wishy-washy consensus in this Parliament.
If there is no economic and social cohesion, if we do not balance the quality of life in the different regions of the Community, we may find ourselves in a situation where the European Union is an unfair European Union in which some regions will make more progress and others will be left behind.

I am usually accused of being too brusque with Members who want to make a point of order.

siretart: From what small I've seen at the wiki, I also got a good impression. One of the reasons ubuntu seems so appealing. :)


Regarding long-term goals, I am of the opinion that there should be no strict deadline, but that Member States should endeavour, in accordance with their own goals, to meet the norms by the time stipulated or earlier.



There is no point in trying to deny anything. Certain facts which have become clear in the last few days, some of which have been the subject of furious political debate in recent weeks, show that, in actual fact, much of the confusion and fear that has been expressed and many of the objections raised are well-founded.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.

Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.

Parliament has taken due note of your comments.


I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter, namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties.




thanks





I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.


One example is the use of peat.
I cannot support your view because the communication is a reproduction of the old European TV and cinema cliché: direct public intervention through State agencies, welfarism and disregard for the nature of the market, a cliché which is characterising the audiovisual sector more and more.
We are presently engaged in a comprehensive review of all our existing financial instruments.
Thanks to the fruitful and probing discussions held within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and also the opinions presented by the rapporteurs of the other committees, this report now lies before you in this form.
If I can use this opportunity, I would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future, for example, we do not manage to vote on a Tuesday evening, we could squeeze in an extra round of voting, so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week.

davybondo, yeah.. if you need to be root, use 'sudo -s' first



has anyone noticed problems with the security update login package in warty?
Hence the importance of our amendments, which sought to achieve this.

In the longer term, consideration should be given to introducing a European public prosecutor to follow up cases of fraud involving EU funds in the Member States.
The Commission has also stated that it is going to increase the additional support granted to disaster aid projects through ECHO.
Are we fearful about Algerian terrorism in our own countries?

Furthermore, it could be said that, rather than fuelling the 'regulation versus self-regulation' debate, the need for efficiency requires us to concentrate on investigating and maximising the use of the synergies between these two modes of operation which, in the case in point, are broadly complementary.


Mr President, certain circumstances could have justified postponing this report to a time when everything was available, including the amendments.
Regarding indirect taxation, in order to combat fraud, and modernise and simplify the acquis in the light of economic developments, in order to take account of the objectives of the Treaty in environmental matters, we propose to act by qualified majority decisions.
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.

The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.
This ought, however, to be done in a broader perspective and not only in relation to changes in fuel consumption.

In line with its mandate, the ECB remains vigilant regarding risks to price stability, as evidenced by its monetary policy decisions in order to nip inflationary pressures in the bud before they materialise rather than to react once price stability is already in jeopardy.
The bottom line in relation to every aspect of the application of GMO technology, particularly in food production, is transparency, consumer information and accurate labelling.

Next Monday, Aung San Suu Kyi will be 55 years old.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, consensus was achieved at the Feira Summit a couple of weeks ago on the idea that flexibility should be on the IGC agenda.

There are 100 million people working in the EU in the private sector and, of these, 32 million people work in micro-businesses, which is businesses of less than 10 people; 33 million people work in small to medium enterprises, with less than 249 people.


In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.
That is precisely why I consider the report to be an ideal basis for our future work on this issue, which is also why I am going to vote in favour of it tomorrow.

If the Charter is ready in time, the Intergovernmental Conference will have to define the procedures for its incorporation into the Treaty.



Could the Commission be specific about this?
thank you drive thru




This issue comes under the general transparency rules of the European institutions which were, in fact, defined in the conclusions of the last European Council, in Helsinki, and I quote, as "an important element in bringing the Union closer to its citizens and improving efficiency" .




Many in this House, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, have emphasised this aspect for the benefit of small- and medium-sized businesses.
I am pleased to see that after several decades of Communist dictatorship, Slovenia has enshrined these values as the foundations of the State.
It is crucial for the construction of a peaceful and harmonious Europe, a Europe united in its objective and at ease with itself and its citizens.
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.
I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty.


I think, for example, of some of the conclusions of the Wergens report, and we would have expected more from the Commission than proposals for greater dialogue and the exchange of best practice.
This has now resulted in a percentage which is nearer to 0 than 90 and which may not be made public.
Action should not normally last for more than nine months.
ogra: <-- rox
I can give you two examples of this.
- (FR) I was very happy to learn, last June, that the Cologne European Council had decided to convene a Convention (made up of representatives of the Heads of State and Government, the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the Commission) that would be responsible for drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights.

This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.


But we have to recognise that the political situation in Yugoslavia and the way in which Mr Milosevic is continuing to behave at international level justify maintaining these sanctions, and this remains the unanimous view of the Council.

However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.
We are of course delighted that we have a highly qualified High Representative in the person of Mr Solana, but it has always been the aim of the European Parliament in the long run to have a European foreign secretary incorporated into the Community area as part of the Commission.


As Mr Olsson said, it is unethical.
I am not going to expand on what the stages have been, since you are perfectly familiar with them.

The banana is now one of the great basic human foodstuffs and control of the trade clearly has a geostrategic dimension.
We would have liked to see more precise details about the specific nature of the European approach to this subject and, in particular, on how the Commission proposes to help the Member States to check the headlong race towards standardisation, an exact blueprint of the American model, which is bound to encourage the development of these tools on the basis of purely technical and commercial considerations.



With reference to the EC Treaty, my report was written with due regard to Article 14, concerning free movement of persons, and Articles 17 and 18 concerning European citizenship, which entails the right to move and to reside freely throughout the territory of the European Union.



Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, practice has shown that scandals and crises can have a cleansing effect and can help improve legislation. This is most certainly the case for all legislation related to food safety, either directly or indirectly.
This is where we need to get to.
However, we have a problem, at present, with different voltage systems.


We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.

The Commission principally defines three initiatives for achieving greater efficiency: on the one hand, making the decision-making process more dynamic, focussing the activity of the "MED Committee" on strategic planning and programming.
Mr Wiebenga said that I did not clearly and specifically condemn Echelon.





I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.
The Union' s first act of generosity, and I must stress that once again, must be to be ready to open its doors to new Members by January 2003.



However, I know for a fact that the Community directive on this issue states that, if the person in question agrees to a reference to their religion, then it is not prohibited to include such personal data.

Furthermore, we should take account, for the purposes of coordination, of the programmes of financial aid of the Member States and the Community regions.

Mr President, I want to address the President of free Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, personally, together with his government and socialist-oriented party, Zanu-PF.
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.

garcia79, are you using a router?
We can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it.
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.

The last point that I have time to make is to the producers of quality chocolate by the specialised methods we see in Belgium and some other areas.
In my judgement, to sum up, it is the following: the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market.
well there are so many i don't know which ones to go with

In the short-term, there needs to be severe restriction of the number of goods vehicles passing through the region, including the Mont Blanc Tunnel when it reopens at the end of this year.
We shall coordinate the actions of the various Member States within the CAEP, given that it is the Member States that are the signatories of the ICAO, and I hope that Parliament will support initiatives such as the single sky, to which Mr Ojeda referred, which, naturally, will also have consequences for kerosene saving, if it can be implemented, and the improvement in the allocation and general management of slots.

Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
I take note of your comment and will ensure this does not happen again.
umm they should do just about everything?
Secondly, sport helps us appreciate activities in forma pauperis which involve minority groups that deserve more support, also at European level.


The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.



My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort.




Nine months may be a long time for a human being to develop before birth, but it is an extremely short time for a candidate country.





But the procedures are unwieldy and not transparent enough, the specification for the implementation of projects, which are too long...
Mr Barón Crespo, I quite understand your objection.
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.

I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.


Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.

It will double again in the coming ten years.

The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 24, 25 and 26 in principle, and will also take them into account when it redrafts Article 9 as part of its amended proposal.
I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I hope, given the degree of adjustment and development, that we are now on the finishing touches.



bob2: Works fine?

At the same time, however, both the Court of Auditors and the Council of Ministers grant this refusal to issue a declaration of assurance the status of a mere water-level report, while we here in Parliament and the media see it as an indication of the poor state of the Union' s finances.




Ladies and gentlemen, this is an interesting report in that the first reading took place as long ago as March 1987.

What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?




- (PT) Once again, the European Parliament finds itself compelled to adopt a maximalist position on the institutions, a position bereft of any realism.
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.


I agree that other measures may be possible but there is not currently a framework of financing which would allow us to go further, particularly in terms of acting to reinforce the infrastructures.
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.
The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build.
The debate on this dossier in the committee I have the honour to chair has been an excellent example of cooperation between different committees in Parliament and indeed of cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council presidency.


In the Belgian federation, the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution.








A measured policy is, in our opinion, the best way to achieve these objectives.

The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.

I will not pretend to be happy with this situation.
Hence, Article 92(2)(b) of the EC Treaty states that 'aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences' shall be compatible with the common market.
Secondly, another problem is the temptation of some wealthier countries to penalise those countries which, since they receive Cohesion Funds, have achieved nominal convergence on the basis of serious, responsible, sympathetic and rigorous structural and economic policies, but clearly still without achieving true convergence, by eliminating them, in this case, from the Cohesion Fund, which could give rise to two possible situations.

Whether it is subsequently to be incorporated into the Treaty in a form that is binding will depend upon an assessment of whether the content of the Charter would provide citizens with better protection than that which they have at present.
However, I see that a total of nine new proposed amendments have been tabled for this plenary sitting which were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment.








I should like once again to extend my thanks on behalf of the Commission, especially to the rapporteur at the time, Mrs van der Laan and, in this context, to the rapporteur for the reforms, Mr van Hulten.
I still have many requests from Members to speak.


This was one of the Commission' s suggestions in its second communication.
Tibet' s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated.
This is really something that is quite unnecessary I would have thought in the post cold-war environment.

The proposal will not force Member States to give legal recognition to unmarried partnerships, but if they do they must treat unmarried partners like spouses.



Far too often, we see that the short-term interests of powerful industrial groups are given priority, whilst the majority of our electorate increasingly sets different requirements for political decision-making.

I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.
The consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous, particularly for cod and redfish, two highly valued sources of food.
There is clearly a great deal of ethnographic data which can be collected and protected as world heritage.
Mr Alyssandrakis, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is in favour of mankind' s direct or indirect access to space for, in the first place, it is a dream, a fantastic adventure and a way of expanding our knowledge.
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.
You see, in Berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments. But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts.
Europe and the European economy are doing well.
Anyone who does not keep up with this progress, these new requirements, risks becoming marginalised, undervalued in his or her professional life, risks losing social status and suffering intellectual impoverishment.
I suppose, then, that the Council will be reluctant to require assent because the Council is not in the habit of going much further than is required by the Treaties in terms of consultation with Parliament.
We entrust the matter to your wisdom and authority.
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission.

The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women' s representation and that all political parties must take action.
However, the number of fatal occupational accidents has increased in recent years and an ever increasing number of people are being widowed or orphaned due to occupational accidents, particularly in the construction industry, where this directive is intended to reduce the number of accidents.

I also wish to say that the aspects relating to safety standards must also be developed soon and I am going to propose to Parliament and the Council that we hold a debate, not on the nuclear sector, nor on the coal or renewable energy sector, but on the guarantees of the European Union' s energy supply as a whole, when we will be able to consider the different sources of energy and the problems relating to each of them, because nothing is free, everything has its price, its pros and cons.



You have ascertained that in most areas that were central to the 1997 budgetary discharge procedure the measures taken by the Commission merit approval because we are heading in the right direction.


Mrs Wallis spoke of the right balance that has been struck and this was echoed by Mrs McCarthy.
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.
I give my full backing to any action undertaken by the Commission on this score.
I am pleasantly surprised that such a major, essential measure has been able to obtain the unanimous consensus of the Committee, for I honestly did not think that it would have been possible.
However, there are a number of other organisations - to mention only those that relate to the tuna species - and, alongside the aforementioned Atlantic tuna organisation, there is a pressing need for our presence in, and commitment to, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC, the Inter-American Commission for Tropical Tuna, the IATTC, or the MHLC, the Multilateral High Level Conference, which is negotiating the convention that will govern the Western Pacific Council.
So I know what I bought.
bur[n] er_, ok, that's part of it, will I have to edit the config scripts manually if I want apache to run a certain way?
The European Commission's Europe-by-satellite service is continuing its support by making available time on its service for independent TV stations in Serbia to broadcast information which will reach the rest of the region and encourage exchange of programmes.

The basis of this proposal is that the discovery of any TSE or the first incidence of BSE in a Member State would be covered by common rules which would take effect automatically.
This idea is one we should stick to, I think.
The convention which is drafting the Charter on Fundamental Rights has begun its work and I believe that we are already doing so at cruise speed.
Therefore, the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities.



We do not want a Lego approach to enlargement.
The last Parliament exercised this new responsibility on six occasions, but only once did it lead to a legislative proposal being brought forward by the Commission in response to our request, namely the proposals originating in the report of my colleague, Mr Rothley, on insurance for people using their vehicles in other Member States.

That is why I am supporting the fact that this is finally being introduced now.
Despite this, there is still a blemish on the new Convention.

Now remember this is a humanitarian force, which is planning to use a weapon that will leave an enormous legacy of cancers among the very civilians it is supposed to be there to protect.
LostMonk: only thing you might have issues with itself is the network card. do you know what network card you have?

Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
Madam President, today offers an important corrective opportunity and an important step forward in this debate.

It should ensure that it meets the deadline, to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004, and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners.




People who read this warning will not buy these toys for their children or grandchildren.

My colleague Franz Fischler will go into this in greater detail in a moment but I should like at this point to thank Mr Casaca for his report and to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report.
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document. And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.

The first Agreement on the European Economic Area was offered to the EFTA countries.
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.
It is not enough to have a few successful but extremely modest Socrates projects about the euro in Europe' s schools.
It is nonetheless unfortunate that only eight countries in the world have managed to meet the essential obligations which follow on from these with regard to equality in education, paid work and a minimum representation of 30% in national parliaments.
If we keep going at this rate, shopkeepers will have to issue owners' manuals with every pound of minced beef - not, of course, that we are allowed to use pounds any more.

Options for the EU to assist in such development should not be excluded, as they say.




So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.

A majority of African countries are overwhelmingly dependent on just one or two commodities for the bulk of their foreign exchange earnings.
AFAIU one reason to prefer Ubuntu to Debian on a server is that Debian woody is 2 years old, and Debian sarge does not have security updates
However, irregular plots cannot simply stop being subject to checks altogether, as is recommended, at least implicitly, in Amendments Nos 5 and 16 and I cannot therefore agree to these amendments.
I do not think, however, that the position of the other countries is any more restricted in Ecofin than it was at the beginning.
On the other side, there are the Member States, which are more than willing to offload their problems onto the oh-so-distant Europe, forgetting in the process that they are part of Europe themselves, and the Commission is piggy-in-the-middle.
We are seeking to implement best practice.

We must therefore act quickly in order to contribute to its development.
i will participate as translator for Ubuntu linux in my native language czech
It is a European initiative which we can consider to have been successful on the whole, since it was implemented in this decentralised fashion, closer to the citizens, having involved the national, regional and local authorities in each Member State.
I entreat Commissioner Schreyer to give very specific answers to this request and would ask her whether she would be prepared to take any initiative in this matter before 30 June.
Mrs Schleicher, it would be particularly tragic if children were to suffer because it is impossible to receive an education.
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.
All this makes me wonder whether this coup is merely the thin end of the wedge.

In short, we are giving our wholehearted support to reform and we hope from the bottom of our hearts that the deadline is met.

The objective of the French Republic is simple and is very clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement.
However, the other side of the coin as regards opting for stability in this way has been less flexibility in access to farming, which particularly penalises young farmers, first of all because of the difficulty in gaining access to quotas, production or premium rights. Secondly, young farmers are penalised as a result of increases in land prices due to the increase in value created by the quota systems.
Now, we know that 10% of an iceberg is visible but the other 90% is underwater and therefore hidden.

sabdfl: I don't expect it will -- I'l speak up if it's going to be a problem.
Within the context of this policy for south-eastern Europe it is evident that the area' s socio-economic reconstruction will play an extremely important part.


A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.


This has made it possible, as the Commission' s report points out, for intra-Community sea transport activity to increase by 23% between 1990 and 1997.
No appreciable percentage of an ultramodern industrial state' s energy needs can be met from wind power.
We now have before us a legally binding directive which Parliament can be fully proud of.
So I hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject.


The consequences for both employees and managers is the same: greater mobility and faster and faster adjustment.



It is also significant insofar as its conclusions could not have been more feeble.



I should like to say that what I have heard this morning from both institutions gives rise to more questions than answers.
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.
But the Central Bank, for example, is not concerned with the euro' s external value.
It is now ten years since the Basque parliament approved the right to self-determination but, nevertheless, the Spanish Government has deliberately ignored this free democratic decision adopted in the Basque Country.
Democracy in the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean because that will help us to understand one another, and development because, apart from anything else, development will reduce the flood of immigrants we have and will continue to have in years to come.
For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective.
Nonetheless, the error rate has remained at the same high level for the last five years.
Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection.

tha_gamemaster: I haven't tried it in about 18 months though...


However, funding for multiannual programmes and large-scale projects is undesirable, because the Commission is not allowed to pursue independent policy on behalf of the said partner countries.
However, in terms of the social dialogue at European level, both sides of industry in Europe are already heavily involved in two aspects of Community action: coordination of economic policies, and the effort to implement the European strategy for jobs.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0535/2000).
The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget, since transport communications are so vital for the economy, employment and, furthermore, for social cohesion.

It can thus now go ahead.
In the external aid area, on the other hand, the figures in the financial perspectives would have resulted in a reduction in expenditure next year in comparison with this year and I think that everyone is agreed that this does not really reflect the actual situation and actual requirements.


It is a concern which must be taken with the greatest seriousness.


We must be consistent, as I will remind the Council when we come to discuss the budgetary issues.

Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.




try one of the ducati style ones



I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.

Mr President, we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the Erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster.








But when I then submitted a second question as a result of yesterday morning's debate on the incursion of the Turkish occupying army into another part of Cyprus, instead of replying on the issue which I had put to him, he said "I have already replied" .

Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.
That is important in our own countries, but we still have a long way to go throughout the European Union.

We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.
The Prime Minister again referred to the importance of that.

I am not aware of the reasons which prompted the movers of the motions to do this - you must ask them yourself - but clearly, if they have been withdrawn, then we cannot vote on them.
We have to improve the ways that we do that.
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.


And it is even more important that these experts join forces, that they are coordinated, and here again Europol presents itself as the appropriate institution.

The audio-visual sector is of the utmost importance to competitiveness, employment, and culture, too, in Europe.
The Community therefore has to keep up with progress and endeavour to ensure that digital technology fulfils its potential as an opportunity for culture, pluralism, cultural and linguistic diversity and for the European economy and technical innovation and research in Europe.


We only hope now that this efficiency really can also be transferred to the more permanent work in the reconstruction bureau and to the EU' s operations within the framework of UNMIK.
They should hence be used with even more care than national funds.
We should form a Community, and I do not feel that we can subsequently come back to this sensitive issue if we do not resolve it now. As I said, we must form a Community of 27 or 28 Member States, despite the much greater disparities.
Mr President, I came to this opinion on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee with many misgivings.


The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
What can the Commission do about that?
With specific regard to training, to which you made reference, as you know, in Greece there is the EKEPIS [National Certification Centre for Vocational Training], a certification centre set up with the approval of the Council, which has had very satisfactory results and has made some positive assessments. Over the next period it will complete its certification procedures.
Another person, who is totally handicapped, said that they wanted to go to London but that they could not do so because they would have lost their pension.
Initial results will be available by the end of the year.
Mr Blak, allow me to apologise officially.




shoot them to put them out of their misery? ;)
In Italy, for example, workers are still unable to discover the size of the pensions they will receive and how much money they have paid in contributions. They are therefore ignorant of some of their personal data.

I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.
Mr President, congratulations to Parliament for adopting this directive which compels firms which are overdue in settling their debts to add on 7% interest.
I do not understand at all how, after what happened, this House can have chosen not to vote on the resolutions on Ethiopia, which are urgent, and have allowed itself to proceed to other votes. I find this quite incomprehensible and I think that it makes this Parliament and us look ridiculous.
More than 60% of the report voted upon consisted of amendments.

Mr President, allow me first of all to emphasise that, in the referendum on the Edinburgh Agreement in 1993, the Danish people declined to participate in EU cooperation on legal issues, and Denmark is not, therefore, bound by any legal obligations to allow the EU to decide which refugees are to be received by Denmark.

There will have to be acknowledgement of the political rights of citizens and the human rights of every individual person. Fundamental rights will have to be defined in the face of fresh hazards.


We might then, also, reiterate what the report said, by emphasising the risk that concentrating research infrastructures, with a view to establishing a cost-effective critical mass, would represent for the peripheral regions, which are, in general, increasingly being disregarded by European programmes.


It is indeed true that information has appeared in a Turkish newspaper about a list of people considered to be undesirable in Turkey.

Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.
Only on points such as legislation, which is in Sweden' s remit, does the country not meet the criteria.

If this is not the case, it will be withdrawn in the near future.

It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.

Treenaks: users frequently report bugs on the users mailing list


Because bird colonies are affected by many factors in addition to fishing, I wish to propose that the Committee on Fisheries be included in future discussions about closures or limitations on quotas against the background of what is happening on land.

Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors, the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments.
I also back the rapporteur' s decision to deal extensively with the women' s rights issue.
This week we have voted for environmentally-friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail.

We must no longer blame anyone else.

Are you intending to create incentives, with a view to ensuring that live transport is carried out in such a way that is actually tolerable for the animals concerned?

There is a specific paragraph on these regions.
The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last.

The workers at BNFL raised the issue.




Hydroelectric power in the Nordic countries is an environmentally friendly and natural energy source that can often be produced at a competitive price, as is the case at present, thanks to a good water supply.
The listing of category imposes costs on farmers and butchers, and at the same time would give consumers irrelevant or misleading information.

Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States, so that the Commission can intervene immediately.


I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.
Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations?
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.

That is the right way forward.
With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia, the PPE Group, as a whole, should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections, then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes.

Incidents of this nature must be condemned immediately by Parliament and others, for it is unthinkable that any hint of anti-Semitism and xenophobia should still be allowed to exist within our Union.


Fourthly, this is about an emancipatory labour market policy.

Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.

Mr Schmitt' s report does not offer any potential solutions to all these problems.
the user is in the sudoers?
The Commission has practically finished the preparation of a Green Paper on the security of supply and on the Kyoto commitments, that is to say, the conditions for emissions in the energy sector. This Green Paper will be adopted before the end of the year.

I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights, after 11.00 p.m., but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population.


More often than not, it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation.
On 11 May Mr Gusinsky's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles.
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.
In such an examination by groups any analysis of individual areas may be overlooked, but questions can be examined from a broader viewpoint.
10. Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns.

Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.
If that happened things would be much, much more difficult and would take much longer.



The process of evaluation of staff, and that of course includes managers at all levels, is being refined and will be introduced.
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0532/00).

- (FR) Today, Parliament adopted the common position on the legal aspects of electronic commerce as it stands.
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.

The only certainty is that some groups in the European Parliament have given financial support to the Europarties, contrary to the regulations concerning parliamentary funds.
I doubt whether simply demanding quotas and percentages is the right way to achieve greater representation, and it should surely not be this Parliament' s job to call for 40% representation in all political fields at national and international level.



We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.
It think it should be made clear that the potential application of this patent in human cells is to guide the production of particular cells that could be useful in transplantation therapy for conditions such as Parkinson' s disease, strokes, diabetes and heart failure.
Firstly, decentralised cooperation and the activities generated by the Barcelona Process between the most active social operators from the non-Community Mediterranean countries and the European Union. These are projects, which, as well as having intrinsic value, create growth in the social sectors in these countries.
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.
It is my great pleasure to give the floor to the Prime Minster, António Guterres.
Furthermore, the Presidency' s conclusions define the four pillars which will form the future basis of the joint European policy on asylum and immigration.

any luck, lostmonk?





What the Commission does intend to do, however, is to add substance to the decisions taken by the European Council at Lisbon, namely to free up the markets for gas, electricity, transport and postal services a lot faster.
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.




Zotnix, any idea how to get around it?


Because, before I left for Strasbourg, I met a former Member of the European Parliament, Mrs Monica Baldi, who is very au fait with cultural issues. While we were discussing this report over a good coffee in a bar, she said to me: "Why is it that this report hopes to reduce the number of cultural sites listed in Italy?
In this way, there is a growing danger that the genetic inheritance of mankind will be taken from the community as a whole and made into a profitable commodity for the few.









We reject government by officials as much as we reject government by judges.
Mr President, surely you agree that these are not explanations of vote, but simply a continuation of the debate.
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.
I am a member of the Committee on Culture and in fact Parliament has not taken up the opinion of this committee.
